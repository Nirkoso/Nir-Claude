# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a LinkedIn B2B marketing strategy repository containing two comprehensive client acquisition frameworks:

1. **LinkedIn Funnel** - A complete LinkedIn-based funnel system for B2B client acquisition through organic content and lead magnets
2. **Warm Leads System** - An 8-phase client acquisition system designed for B2B service providers and IT companies

Both systems are designed to solve the same core B2B marketing problems: confusing messaging, lack of predictable lead generation, and insufficient trust-building.

## Repository Structure

### Root Level
- **linkedin-funnel-concept.md** - Complete 11-stage LinkedIn funnel framework focused on organic content, lead magnets, and email nurture sequences

### Warm_Leads_System Directory
An 8-file sequential system that must be implemented in order:

**Phase 1: Clarify Marketing Messaging**
- **1-system-structure.md** - Overview of the entire system and its foundational principles (7-Hour Rule, Trust/Time/Touch Points)
- **2-offer-generator.md** - Framework for packaging services using the proven offer formula
- **3-conversion-accelerator.md** - Building high-converting landing page sequences with calendar booking and priming videos

**Phase 2: Set up a Sales Call Engine**
- **4-pipeline-reactivator.md** - 7-8 day warm outreach campaign leveraging scarcity and urgency
- **5-prospecting-playbook.md** - Cold outreach (email, automated messaging) and LinkedIn content strategy (Grow/Educate/Capture pillars)
- **6-ads-masterclass.md** - LinkedIn Ads strategy with 70/20/10 budget allocation (Core Offer/Brand Awareness/Remarketing)

**Phase 3: Build Trust and Convert**
- **7-nurture-autopilot.md** - Remarketing campaigns to answer objections and build trust automatically
- **8-follow-up-flow.md** - Pre-call and post-call optimization, including Loom videos, decision-maker targeting, and reactivation sequences

## System Philosophies

### Core Principles (Warm Leads System)
Both systems are built on the relationship-building principle that B2B requires more trust-building than B2C due to higher financial investment:

- **7-Hour Rule**: 7 hours of interaction needed to move to the next relationship level
- **Multiple Hits**: Interactions across different contexts compress perceived time and accelerate trust

### Three Core Problems Solved
1. Confusing marketing messaging (prospects don't understand what you do)
2. Lack of predictable system (no consistent client flow)
3. Lack of trust (calls don't close)

### LinkedIn Funnel Philosophy
- You're not selling a call - you're guiding prospects from curiosity to commitment through micro-value exchanges
- Lead magnets follow the 3V Rule: Value (quick wins), Velocity (under 10 minutes), Vision (desire for full solution)
- Comment-to-DM strategy leverages LinkedIn's algorithm (engagement signals boost visibility)

### Warm Leads System Philosophy
- Sequential implementation: Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2, etc.
- Multi-channel stability: Use warm outreach, cold outreach, content, and ads (avoid "one-legged stool")
- Don't pitch, help: All outreach focuses on offering value, not selling
- Automation after validation: Only automate (ads, remarketing) what's proven to work organically

## Key Frameworks and Formulas

### Offer Packaging Formula (2-offer-generator.md)
"We help [target audience as they describe themselves] achieve [tangible outcome] in [time period] with our unique delivery mechanism called [Your USP] and without [something you don't want to do]."

### LinkedIn Content Pillars (5-prospecting-playbook.md)
1. **Grow**: Story-based content for reach and network growth
2. **Educate**: Expert-building content (fewer views expected)
3. **Capture**: Outcome-focused posts with DM keyword CTAs

**Cadence**: Four Gives, One Take (Monday: Grow, Tuesday: Educate, Wednesday: Capture, Thursday: Educate, Friday: Grow)

### LinkedIn Ads Budget Allocation (6-ads-masterclass.md)
- 70% Core Offer (main revenue driver)
- 20% Brand Awareness/Thought Leadership (boost organic content)
- 10% Remarketing (halves cost per call by targeting warm audiences)

### Lead Magnet Post Structure (linkedin-funnel-concept.md)
- Hook: Call out problem or exciting result
- Body: Tease insights inside the resource
- CTA: "Comment '[keyword]' and I'll send it to you"
- Reply to every comment within 1 hour to double visibility

## Tools and Platforms Referenced

### Warm Leads System
- **Sales Navigator**: Creating ideal prospect lists
- **Eva Boot**: Finding prospect email addresses
- **Instantly**: Email campaign sending
- **Drify**: Automated LinkedIn connection requests and messaging
- **LinkedIn Ads**: Primary paid acquisition channel for B2B
- **Loom**: Post-call video summaries

### LinkedIn Funnel System
- **ConvertKit/Beehiiv/Carrd/Webflow**: Landing page builders (KIT recommended)
- **Framer**: Offer page creation (one page works for all lead magnets)
- **Calendly/VSSL/TidyCal**: Calendar booking tools

## Target Metrics

### LinkedIn Funnel Benchmarks (linkedin-funnel-concept.md)
- Post engagement rate: 3-5%+
- Opt-in conversion rate: 35-60%
- Offer page click-to-call rate: 15-25%
- Show-up rate: 80%+
- Close rate: 25-40%

### Volume Goals
- After 4-6 weeks of consistency: 20-40 booked calls/month
- Post daily (5x/week minimum)
- 2-3 lead magnet posts per week

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Working with These Documents

1. **Respect Sequential Order**: Warm Leads System files (1-8) must be implemented in order - later phases depend on earlier ones
2. **Don't Skip Phase 1**: Without clarified messaging (files 2-3), all other efforts are less effective
3. **Multi-Channel Approach**: Implement multiple acquisition methods (warm, cold, content, ads) for stability
4. **Validate Before Automating**: Test organic approaches before investing in ads or automation

### Content Strategy Rules
- Never pitch in outreach - always lead with value
- Limit cold outreach to 3 messages total (initial + 2 follow-ups)
- Post frequency matters more than perfection
- Engagement (commenting, replying) is as important as posting

### Trust-Building Tactics
- Use priming videos after calendar booking to start the 7-hour trust clock
- Send Loom video summaries after every sales call to control the narrative
- Remarket to decision-makers at prospect companies (not just the contact)
- Send case studies via automated emails during follow-up period

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up a New Client Acquisition Campaign
1. Start with Warm Leads System file 1 (system structure) to understand foundations
2. Create offer using framework in file 2 (offer generator)
3. Build landing page sequence per file 3 (conversion accelerator)
4. Launch quick-win campaign using file 4 (pipeline reactivator)
5. Set up ongoing prospecting per file 5 (prospecting playbook)
6. Scale with ads using file 6 (ads masterclass)
7. Implement remarketing per file 7 (nurture autopilot)
8. Optimize conversion with file 8 (follow-up flow)

### Creating Lead Magnet Content (LinkedIn Funnel)
1. Review sections 3-4 in linkedin-funnel-concept.md for framework and promotion strategy
2. Apply 3V Rule: Value, Velocity, Vision
3. Format as Notion doc, PDF, or Google Doc
4. End with booking CTA
5. Create comment-to-DM post with keyword trigger
6. Reply to all comments within 1 hour

### Optimizing an Existing Funnel
1. Check metrics against benchmarks in section 10 of linkedin-funnel-concept.md
2. Identify bottlenecks in the funnel stages
3. Review trust-building components (priming videos, nurture sequences, remarketing)
4. Ensure all three content pillars (Grow/Educate/Capture) are being used
5. Verify ad spend allocation follows 70/20/10 model

## Strategic Notes

- The LinkedIn Funnel and Warm Leads System are complementary approaches - LinkedIn Funnel focuses on organic content and lead magnets, while Warm Leads System emphasizes a full-stack paid + organic approach
- Both systems emphasize that B2B sales require trust-building across multiple touch points before conversion
- The "don't pitch, help" philosophy is central to both frameworks
- Remarketing is considered the highest-leverage activity in both systems (lowest cost, highest conversion)
- The goal is to make sales calls an "order-taking activity" by handling objections and building trust before the call
