# Follow-up Flow

**Phase 3: Build Trust and Convert**

## Objective
Maximize call show-up rates and positively influence the post-call decision-making process within the prospect's organization.

## Pre-Call Optimization (Ensuring Show-Up)

### 1. Optimize Booking Window
Ensure bookings are close to the inquiry (ideally only two or three days in advance). If the time window is too long, the prospect might "go to sleep," wake up, and their state or problems might shift.

### 2. SMS & Email Automations
Set up automated reminders once (SMS and email).

### 3. Value-Driven Follow-up (Selling the Call)
- Do not stop communication; "sell the call" by warming them up.
- Start building trust by giving them freebies.
- Answer all of their questions. Do everything you would normally do in the sales call without them actually having to get on the call.

## Post-Call Follow-up (Influencing Internal Decisions)

### 1. Remarketing to Decision-Makers (Internal Influence)
- Since B2B often involves discussion with other people in their organization, use LinkedIn remarketing to positively influence these internal conversations.
- Add specific companies and key job roles (e.g., the CFO or Head of HR at "Microsoft") to your remarketing campaign.
- This ensures the internal influencers start seeing your ads and building trust with you. The result is that other people in the client's network advise the decision-maker to use you.

### 2. Loom Video Summary (Controlling the Narrative)
Record a quick Loom video immediately after the sales call while the conversation is fresh in your head. Repeat back the person's problems, desired solutions, and your pitch.

**Three Key Benefits:**
1. Helps the person you spoke to remember the details.
2. Provides you with a reference point (so you can watch it back and remember their pains/desires when reinitiating conversation).
3. It is guaranteed they will send that video to all the other decision-makers. This allows you to control the narrative of your pitch instead of relying on their cohort repeating your words.

### 3. Add Decision-Makers to Network
Add the person you spoke to and any other decision-makers to your network. They will then passively see your organic content and ads daily, providing more trust, touch points, and different contexts.

### 4. Automated Emails (Case Studies)
Set up automated emails containing case studies similar to their situation. This proves that other people have already successfully walked that path and achieved the promised outcome.

### 5. Prep Emails (Assuming the Close)
Send emails that assume the close, explaining what they need to prepare or change in their organization to make starting easier.

### 6. Book a Follow-up Call
Always book a specific follow-up call rather than leaving the decision "in the ether".
- **Hint:** Put an emoji at the start of the calendar event to make it stand out.
- A follow-up call creates a "point in the sand," letting them know they must make a decision at some point.

### 7. Value-Driven Follow-up (Continued)
Every time you follow up, send them more value (e.g., upgrading a free trial to the "Supreme version"). The goal is to give, not to be "needy" or ask.

### 8. Reactivation (30–60 Days)
- If the prospect does not close, wait a period of time (30 to 60 days, depending on the sales cycle).
- Enter them into a private, one-on-one automatic pipeline reactivator.
- This is a limited-time offer (usually a case study offer) specific to them, which leverages scarcity and urgency to push them to take action.
