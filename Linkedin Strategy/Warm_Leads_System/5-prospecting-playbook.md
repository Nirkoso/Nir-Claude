**Phase 2: Set up a Sales Call Engine**

## Objective
Provide "fuel for the fire" by expanding your network and nurturing the existing audience.

## Components

### 1. Email Outreach (Cold)

- **List Creation:** Use Sales Navigator to create lists of your ideal prospects.
- **Email Finding:** Use a tool called Eva Boot to run through those searches and find the prospects' email addresses.
- **Sending:** Use software like Instantly to send emails to those prospects.
- **Strategy:** Email marketing is less effective than it used to be because everyone pitches immediately. We are not pitching; we are offering to help them.
- **Highly Effective Technique - The Video Pitch:** Reach out offering to share a quick video explaining how you helped another similar company achieve a result, asking, "Do you want me to send it over?". This is offering to share information that assists them, starting a conversation that can then be pushed toward a call.

### 2. Automated Messaging

Use a tool called Drify to run the same search (as used for email), send connection requests (which increases your network), and then automatically message people.

### 3. Outreach Rules (Consistency)

- Do not pitch anyone.
- Genuinely just try to help them.
- Only send one initial message and two follow-ups (three messages total). After three messages, the reply rate "absolutely plummets". This strategy avoids annoying people and allows you to send more volume (to more people), which is better.

### 4. LinkedIn Content (Nurturing)

The goal of this content is not to become a LinkedIn influencer with 100,000 followers. It is the best way of nurturing your existing audience.

**Three Content Pillars:**

1. **Grow:** Content that talks about stories (e.g., how you got from X to Z). This type of content tends to get large reach and brings more people into your network.
2. **Educate:** Content designed to build you up as an expert in your field. This type gets fewer views, which is okay.
3. **Capture:** Content that flips the script so the prospects approach you. Posts discuss an outcome (how you helped someone achieve it) and ask users to DM a specific keyword (e.g., "growth," "summer," "spring") for more information.

### 5. Content Cadence

Use a **Four Gives, One Take cadence** ("give, give, give, give, then take"). This avoids boring people by constantly asking for the sale (capturing).

**Example Schedule:**
- Monday (Grow)
- Tuesday (Educate)
- Wednesday (Capture)
- Thursday (Educate)
- Friday (Grow)
