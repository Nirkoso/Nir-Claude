**Phase 1: Clarify Marketing Messaging**

## Objective
Package your service attractively ("in chocolate") and completely shift the dynamic so prospects approach you instead of you having to chase them. This resolves the core problem of confusing marketing messaging.

## Steps for Offer Generation

### 1. Understand Target Audience (TA) Pains and Desires
- You must have an actual understanding of your TA's pains and desires.
- The goal is to be able to repeat back their pains and desires better than they can articulate it themselves. If you can do this, you will have a really easy time acquiring clients.

### 2. Information Gathering
- A fantastic way to gain this detailed information is by recording sales calls and listening back to what people say.
- You will frequently find patterns in what people say, including the same emotional problems, the same tangible/physical problems, and roughly the same desires (they want the same things). These patterns are what you need to focus on.

### 3. Utilize a GPT Marketing Assistant
- To make rolling out this entire framework as quick and easy as possible, train your own GPT model.
- This custom GPT acts as a marketing assistant and is reportedly better than 99% of most actual marketing assistants. It costs nearly nothing to set up.

### 4. Offer Packaging Structure
Once you have identified the TA's pains and desires, you "pour" them into this new packaging.

**The best, most straightforward packaging structure we have found is:**

"We help [target audience as they describe themselves] achieve [a tangible outcome] in [a time period which seems reasonable and achievable] with our unique delivery mechanism which is called [Your USP] and without [something you're currently doing that you don't want to do]."

**Example Application:**
"We help B2B service providers and IT companies get 10 high-intent sales calls every month on autopilot within the next 30 days with our unique delivery mechanism which is called the control growth framework and without you having to do any icky sales calls and using pushy pitchy tactics."
