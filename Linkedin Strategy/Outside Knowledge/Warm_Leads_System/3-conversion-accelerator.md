# Conversion Accelerator

**Phase 1: Clarify Marketing Messaging**

## Objective
Use the new, clarified messaging to increase the effectiveness of all existing marketing channels. This transforms your website into a "conversion machine".

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Rollout Messaging
Take the new, clarified messaging from the Offer Generator and roll it out across your LinkedIn profile.

### 2. Simple Landing Page Sequence
You must build a very simple landing page sequence. The creator notes that before implementing this, they spent thousands on their old website with a professional designer, only generating one to two inquiries every six months. This new sequence focuses purely on conversion:

- **State the Outcome:** Start by stating the specific outcome someone is going to get by using your service.
- **Ground the Statement:** Explain how you are going to achieve that outcome.
- **Dig into the Pain:** Discuss the pain someone is currently experiencing.
- **Steps to Solution:** Talk them through the steps that will be taken to bring them to the solution.

### 3. Calendar Booking Integration
- Once prospects submit their lead information (like name and email), they are immediately pushed to a calendar booking tool.
- This ensures that everyone who makes an inquiry books directly into your calendar, meaning you don't even have to chase them.

### 4. Priming Video (Building Trust)
- Once they have booked into your calendar, send them onto a video.
- That video starts priming them to use your service.
- Crucially, this video begins the process of building the 7 hours of trust necessary for them to enter the next level of the relationship (i.e., making a large B2B purchase).
