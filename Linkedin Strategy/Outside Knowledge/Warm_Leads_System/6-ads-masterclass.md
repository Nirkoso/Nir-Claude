# Ads Masterclass

**Phase 2: Set up a Sales Call Engine**

## Objective
Automate what is working to achieve scalability, consistency, and predictability.

## Platform Rationale (LinkedIn)

- LinkedIn Ads is the perfect place for B2B. It brings in the highest intent and highest quality leads.
- It is often considered expensive, but the quality of the leads justifies the cost.
- The reason most people struggle is that they go in trying to "pitch slap" everyone. We avoid this by utilizing the clarified core offer.
- Relying on multiple methods of acquisition (cold, warm, content, ads) ensures stability, preventing the business from being like a "one-legged stool" that breaks if that one leg is removed.

## Ad Spend Allocation (Strategic Breakdown)

### 1. 70% Core Offer

- Allocate the majority of the budget to promoting your core offer.
- Target your ideal audience using LinkedIn's highly specific targeting capabilities (e.g., specifying company founders of companies between 11 and 50 employees who are making at least 1 million a year in turnover).

### 2. 20% Brand Awareness/Thought Leadership

- These ads act as "Rocket Fuel" for your organic content.
- Use this budget to boost those conversion posts that ask people to DM a keyword, or posts that get people to book directly into the calendar through the high-converting landing page sequence.

### 3. 10% Remarketing (Critical Component)

- Remarketing is the "really, really, really important part".
- This campaign nearly halved the cost per call in internal tests (e.g., dropping from roughly £130 on the cold tier to £70–£80 on the warm tier).
- Remarketing often leads to more calls booked than cold ads for infinitely less money because it targets a warm audience that already has trust and touch points.
