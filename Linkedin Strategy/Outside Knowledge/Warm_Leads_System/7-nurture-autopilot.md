**Phase 3: Build Trust and Convert**

## Objective
Build trust passively and automatically handle objections before the sales call. This step connects marketing and sales, resolving the "disconnect" that causes unqualified leads and closing issues. This is the phase where the system is "cracked" and can be fully automated.

## Mechanism (Remarketing)

### 1. Audience Creation
Create specific custom audiences within LinkedIn:
- People who visited the high-converting landing page.
- Native LinkedIn audiences such as those who visited your company page, or clicked on one of your ads but did not take the desired action.

### 2. Targeting Focus
- Because the messaging is clarified and the offer is attractive, people clicking are seeking a solution to a problem you solve; they are in the buying cycle.
- You should only remarket to those people who are actively considering a solution.

### 3. Content Framework (Pre-Sale Handling)
The goal is to answer all questions and handle objections before the call, making the call an order-taking activity.

- **Build Trust:** Boost the educational content that you are already posting organically.
- **Answer Buying Questions:** Use content to answer common questions that people ask during the buying cycle (information collected in Phase 1). This prevents them from needing to get on the call just to ask questions.
- **Handle Objections:** Address common objections that arise through content.
- **Social Proof:** Include testimonials, reviews, social proof, and credibility content.

### 4. Conversation Ads (High-Intent Capture)
- Use this official LinkedIn advertising feature.
- Target your smallest, most high-intent audience (e.g., people who visited your website or clicked your offer in the last seven days).
- Automatically have LinkedIn send them a message. This automated, one-to-one communication is highly effective for closing and pushes people in the "warm" stage toward a call.
