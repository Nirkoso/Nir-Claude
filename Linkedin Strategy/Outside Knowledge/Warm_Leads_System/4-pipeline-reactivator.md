**Phase 2: Set up a Sales Call Engine**

## Objective
Set up a one-time sales call engine that runs on autopilot, bringing in consistent and predictable sales calls. This method costs absolutely nothing and generates quick results to build momentum.

## Context (Acquisition Methods)
This method falls under **Warm Outreach**, which is the easiest of the four core client acquisition methods because this audience (your existing network) already knows, likes, and trusts you.

## Core Principles (Compelling Action)
The campaign leverages two core principles identified in the source:

1. **Scarcity:** A limited supply or limited amount of people.
2. **Urgency:** A limited time period.

When used in tandem, these principles compel people who previously would not take action to move forward, often due to the risk of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).

## Execution Steps (7 to 8 Day Campaign)

### 1. Public Post (Leveraging Scarcity/Urgency)
Run a short campaign targeting your existing network for 7 to 8 days. Post publicly on social channels saying you are offering "X amount of people this thing," and it is only available for the limited time period with limited spaces.

### 2. Direct Messaging (The Twist)
Start direct messaging people in your network.

- **Crucial Detail:** Do not pitch them directly, as that can feel icky in your network.
- **Instead, ask:** "Hey, I posted this thing on my social profile, you might have seen it. Do you know anyone else who might benefit from this?".
- **What often happens:** The people you ask will respond by saying that they need the offer themselves.

### 3. Result
This process quickly gets calls booked into the diary that are very easy to close because they originate from your existing network.
