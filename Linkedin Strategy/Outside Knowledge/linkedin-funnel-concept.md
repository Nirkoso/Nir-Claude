# The LINKEDIN FUNNEL

## 🌇 1. The LinkedIn Funnel Overview

Before executing any steps, understand the purpose behind each stage of the funnel:

| Stage       | Goal                                              | Example Output                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Awareness   | Build trust, visibility, and authority            | Educational LinkedIn posts         |
| Engagement  | Capture interest via lead magnets                 | Comment-to-DM posts                |
| Conversion  | Turn interest into a sales opportunity            | Offer & booking page               |
| Nurture     | Move leads closer to buying                       | Automated emails & pre-call sequences |

You’re NOT selling a call — you’re guiding prospects from curiosity to commitment through micro-value exchanges.

## 🔝 2. Content Strategy (Top of Funnel)

### Purpose
Attract and nurture your audience by providing consistent, value-based content that builds trust and positions you as an expert.

### Content Types

1. **Authority Posts**  
   Share frameworks, insights, or “how-tos” demonstrating expertise.  
   Example: “Here’s how we helped a B2B SaaS company increase demo calls by 42% using a 3-step LinkedIn system.”

2. **Case Studies & Results**  
   Prove outcomes. Focus on metrics that matter (revenue, conversions, time savings).  
   Example: “This one optimization increased inbound calls by 28% for a logistics firm.”

3. **Contrarian / Thought Leadership Posts**  
   Challenge common assumptions in your niche.  
   Example: “Why 80% of B2B companies waste money on PPC before fixing this one thing.”

4. **Personal & Vision Posts**  
   Show your values, story, and mission. Builds emotional connection and relatability.

### Cadence
- Post daily (5x/week minimum)
- Engage with others: comment on ideal clients’ posts daily
- Goal: Build awareness and trust before promoting lead magnets

## 🪓 3. Lead Magnet Creation (Mid-Funnel Engagement)

### Purpose
Convert followers and lurkers into leads by giving away high-value, relevant resources that solve an immediate problem.

### Lead Magnet Framework (The 3V Rule)
Every lead magnet should deliver:
- **Value** – Quick-win insights they can apply immediately
- **Velocity** – Fast to consume (under 10 minutes)
- **Vision** – Creates desire to learn your full solution

### Examples for B2B

| Industry              | Lead Magnet Idea                                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Marketing agency      | “7 LinkedIn Content Frameworks That Book Calls”                |
| SaaS company          | “The 2025 SaaS LinkedIn Growth Playbook”                       |
| Consulting firm       | “The B2B Discovery Call Checklist for Enterprise Clients”     |
| Cybersecurity         | “The CEO’s 10-Minute Security Audit”                           |
| Financial services    | “5 Red Flags in Your Company’s Financial Ops”                  |

### Format
- Create as a Notion doc, PDF, or Google Doc
- Include clear sections, visuals/screenshots
- End with CTA:  
  “Want help implementing this? Book a strategy call here → [link]”

**Golden Rule**  
Don’t overdesign it. Perceived value comes from clarity and insight, not aesthetics.

## 🆓 4. Lead Magnet Promotion (LinkedIn Post Funnel)

### Purpose
Drive engagement and capture leads through comments → DMs → opt-in.

### Execution Steps

1. **Post Structure**  
   - Hook: Call out a common problem or exciting result  
     → “This funnel booked 40 calls for us last week — here’s exactly how.”  
   - Body: Tease the insights inside the free resource  
   - CTA: “Comment ‘Guide’ and I’ll send it to you.”

2. **Algorithmic Boost**  
   - Comments signal LinkedIn to push the post harder  
   - Reply to every comment within 1 hour → doubles visibility

3. **DM Flow**  
   “Hey [Name], here’s the resource I mentioned! Grab it here: [Landing Page Link]. Let me know what you think.”

4. **Frequency**  
   2–3 lead magnet posts per week (mix with regular value posts)

## 🌐 5. Landing Page (Opt-in Page)

### Purpose
Capture emails with minimal friction.

### Best Practices
- Headline: Clearly state benefit  
  → “Access the B2B LinkedIn Growth Blueprint (Free 7-Part Guide)”
- Subheadline: Reinforce value & urgency
- Form: First Name + Email only
- Design: Preview of resource + bullet list of what they’ll learn
- CTA button: “Access Now”

### Tools
ConvertKit, Beehiiv, Carrd, Webflow, etc.  
→ I use KIT because honestly it doesn’t matter that much.

## 📃 6. Offer Page (Post-Opt-in Redirect)

### Purpose
Capitalize on peak intent right after they opt-in.

### Structure
1. Headline:  
   “Before you go — see how we help [audience] get [specific outcome].”

2. Short VSL (2–5 mins)  
   - Reintroduce authority  
   - Show 1–2 client wins  
   - End with “Book a Strategy Call”

3. CTA Button → Calendly / VSSL / TidyCal

4. Optional: Link to main website

**Timing Note**  
First 3 days after opt-in are the hottest window.

**Tool**  
I use Framer (you only need one offer page — it works for every lead magnet).

## 📨 7. Email Sequence (Nurture & Conversion)

### Purpose
Turn opt-ins into booked calls by addressing pain points and building trust.

### 3-Day Core Sequence

| Day | Email Focus                        | Goal               |
|-----|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1   | Deliver lead magnet + intro approach | Build trust        |
| 2   | Biggest pain point in niche         | Educate & agitate  |
| 3   | Proof + CTA to book call            | Convert            |

Each email:
- Focuses on one problem
- Includes a case study/story
- Ends with clear CTA (“Book your strategy call here”)

After Day 3 → add to weekly newsletter/nurture flow.

## 📲 8. Pre-Call Nurture Sequence (Show-Up Optimization)

### Purpose
Make sure booked leads show up ready to buy.

### Structure
- 10 emails total leading up to the call
- 2 emails/day (morning + evening)
- Topics: common mistakes, methodology, success stories, call expectations, reminders

**Goal**  
By call time they already know, like, and trust you → less convincing, more closing.

## 🗑️ 9. Qualification Form (Before the Call)

### Purpose
Filter out tire-kickers so only serious buyers reach your calendar.

### Form Fields
- Full name
- Company & role
- Website
- Monthly revenue (or team size)
- Main business challenge
- Desired outcome
- “Are you ready to invest in solving this?” (Yes/No/Maybe)

**Best Practices**
- Friendly tone
- Auto-decline unqualified leads
- Use answers to customize your pitch

## 👣 10. Tracking & Optimization

| Stage              | Metric                       | Target         |
|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Content            | Post engagement rate         | 3–5%+          |
| Lead Magnet        | Opt-in conversion rate       | 35–60%         |
| Offer Page         | Click-to-call rate           | 15–25%         |
| Call Booking       | Show-up rate                 | 80%+           |
| Calls → Clients    | Close rate                   | 25–40%         |

### Optimization Loop
1. Identify bottlenecks
2. Split-test hooks, designs, CTAs
3. Collect qualitative feedback
4. Refine next lead magnet

## 🔊 11. Volume and Consistency

### Posting Cadence
- Daily LinkedIn posts
- 2–3 lead magnet drops/week
- Daily follow-up DMs to new commenters

### Realistic Scaling Goal
After 4–6 weeks of true consistency:
→ 20–40 booked calls/month

Then automate repetitive parts (DMs, emails, reminders) and reinvest time into testing new lead magnets.

This is the complete system — execute it relentlessly and the results compound fast.
