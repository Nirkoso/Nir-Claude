When you modify any playbook file (0-5), you MUST:

4. **Explain why** the change was needed
5. **Note impact** on existing strategies or users
6. **Validate** that changes don't conflict with core frameworks

**Common Change Types:**

- **Benchmark Updates:** New industry data, platform changes, performance trends

- **Content Additions:** New sections, expanded examples, additional templates
- **Error Corrections:** Typos, incorrect data, broken cross-references
- **Structural Changes:** File reorganization, section reordering
