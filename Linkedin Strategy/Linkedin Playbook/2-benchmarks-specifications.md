## 3. Budget Benchmarks

### Minimum Budgets by Campaign Type

| Campaign Type | Total Budget | Daily Budget | Duration | Expected Volume |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Test/Validation | $1,000-2,000 | $30-50 | 2-4 weeks | 10-20 leads |

### Budget Calculation Formula

```
Minimum Monthly Budget = (Target Leads × Expected CPL) + 20% Buffer

Example:
- Goal: 50 leads/month
- Industry CPL: $75
- Calculation: (50 × $75) + 20% = $3,750 + $750 = $4,500/month
- Daily: $4,500 ÷ 30 = $150/day
```

|------|------------|---------|---------------------|
| Core Offer | 70% | Direct conversion | $2,100 |

## 4. Audience Sizing Guidelines

### Optimal Ranges

| Audience Size | Status | Performance | Action |
|---------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| <30K | Critical | Very poor delivery | Expand immediately |
| 30K-50K | Marginal | Poor delivery, high CPL | Enable 15-20% expansion |
| **50K-150K** | **Optimal** | **Stable, efficient** | **Ideal for conversion** |
| **150K-500K** | **Optimal** | **Best for scale** | **Sweet spot** |
| 500K-1M | Large | Good for awareness | May reduce relevance |
| >1M | Very Large | Awareness only | Too broad for conversion |

### Audience Expansion Impact

| Expansion % | Audience Increase | CTR Impact | CPL Impact |
|-------------|------------------|------------|------------|
| 0% (disabled) | Baseline | Baseline | Baseline |
| 10% | +10-15% | -0-5% | -10-15% (improves) |

## 6. ROI & Economic Benchmarks

### LTV/CAC Targets by Stage

| Company Stage | LTV/CAC Ratio | What It Means |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Early (testing) | 1:1 to 2:1 | Break-even to validate |
| Growth | 3:1 | Sustainable scaling |
| Mature | 4:1+ | Efficient optimization |

### Deal Economics

| Deal Size | Acceptable CPL | Max CAC (LTV/3) | Sales Cycle |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| $5K | <$50 | $1,667 | 30-45 days |
| $10K | <$100 | $3,333 | 45-60 days |
| $25K | <$200 | $8,333 | 60-90 days |
| $50K | <$400 | $16,667 | 90-120 days |
| $100K+ | <$800 | $33,333+ | 120-180+ days |

**Formula:**
```
Max Acceptable CAC = (Average Deal Size × Gross Margin) ÷ 3

Example:
- Deal size: $25K
- Gross margin: 70%
- Max CAC: ($25K × 0.70) ÷ 3 = $5,833
- If CPL = $150, need 2.6% lead-to-customer rate to hit target
```
