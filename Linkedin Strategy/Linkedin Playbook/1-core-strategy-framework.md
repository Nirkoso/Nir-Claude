# Core Strategy Framework
**LinkedIn B2B Advertising - Essential Playbook for AI Agents**

Version 1.0 | December 2025

---

## Quick Reference

**When to use this file:** Creating campaign strategies, budget allocation, audience targeting, campaign structure

**Core principles:**
- 70/20/10 budget model (Core Offer / Brand Awareness / Remarketing)
- 2-3 targeting criteria maximum
- 50K-500K audience sweet spot
- Don't pitch, help (value-first philosophy)
- Multi-channel stability (avoid single-channel dependency)

---

## 1. Strategic Foundation

### The 7-Hour Rule
B2B purchases require 7 hours of interaction to build enough trust for major commitments. LinkedIn ads compress this through:
- Multiple touchpoints (awareness → consideration → conversion)
- Different contexts (posts, videos, messages, landing pages)
- Remarketing to warm audiences

**Application:** Design multi-touch journeys, not single-ad conversions.

### Value-First Philosophy
Every touchpoint should help, not sell:
- Lead magnets solve real problems (not "download to get pitched")
- Content educates before asking
- Sales calls positioned as "strategy sessions," not pitches

**Application:** Test offers organically before paid amplification.

### Budget Allocation: The 70/20/10 Model

**70% Core Offer** (Direct Conversion)
- Lead Gen Forms for demos/trials
- Website Visits to high-converting landing pages
- Target: Specific job titles + company size + industry
- Example: "VP Marketing at SaaS companies, 50-500 employees"

**20% Brand Awareness** (Top of Funnel)
- Video ads, Carousel ads, Thought Leadership content
- Boost high-performing organic posts
- Broader targeting (job function vs. specific titles)
- Builds remarketing audiences for the 10% tier

**10% Remarketing** (Warm Audiences)
- Target: Website visitors, video viewers, post engagers
- Formats: Message Ads, Lead Gen Forms
- **Critical insight:** Testing showed remarketing reduced cost per call from £130 to £70-80 (40-50% savings)

**When to adjust:**
- Early stage (no proven offer): 60/30/10 (more awareness)
- Mature (proven ROI): 80/10/10 (maximize core offer)
- Event/launch: 50/30/20 (boost awareness + remarketing)

## 2. Budget Sizing & Scaling

### Minimum Viable Budgets

| Campaign Type | Budget | Use Case |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Test campaign | $1K-2K total (2-4 weeks) | Validate messaging before scaling |
| Small ongoing | $30-50/day ($900-1,500/month) | Niche audiences, limited resources |
| Standard campaign | $100-300/day ($3K-9K/month) | Most B2B companies |
| Large brand campaign | $500+/day ($15K+/month) | Enterprise, major launches |

**Calculate minimum budget:**
```
Minimum Monthly = (Target Leads × Expected CPL) + 20% buffer

Example: 50 leads/month × $75 CPL = $3,750 + 20% = $4,500/month
```

### The 30% Scaling Rule
**Never increase budget more than 30% per week.**

Doubling overnight resets LinkedIn's algorithm, spiking CPL for 5-7 days.

**Safe progression:**
- Week 1: $50/day
- Week 2: $65/day (+30%)
- Week 3: $85/day (+30%)
- Week 4: $110/day (+30%)

### 50/30/20 Growth Allocation
When adding new budget:
- **50% to proven campaigns** (CPL on target, quality >60%)
- **30% to optimization** (A/B tests, creative refresh)
- **20% to experiments** (new formats, audiences, messaging)

---

## 3. Audience Targeting

### The 2-3 Criteria Rule
Combine 2-3 targeting dimensions maximum:

**Primary dimension:**
- Job titles (specific): "VP Marketing," "Director of Sales"
- OR Job function (broad): Marketing, Sales, Engineering

**Secondary dimension:**
- Company size: 50-200, 201-500 employees
- OR Industry: SaaS, Professional Services, Manufacturing

**Tertiary (optional):**
- Geography: USA, specific regions
- OR Seniority: VP-level, Director-level

**Don't over-target:** Using 4+ criteria creates audiences <50K (poor delivery).

### Audience Size Sweet Spot: 50K-500K

**Below 50K:**
- "Low Delivery" warnings
- High CPL
- Algorithm can't optimize
- **Fix:** Enable Audience Expansion 10-20%, add adjacent targeting

**50K-500K:**
- Optimal range
- Stable delivery
- Efficient CPL

**Above 500K:**
- Too broad, relevance decreases
- CTR typically drops
- **Fix:** Add third targeting dimension, narrow seniority

### Matched Audiences (Remarketing)

**Create immediately:**
- Website visitors (all pages, last 180 days)
- High-intent pages (pricing, demo, case studies, last 30 days)
- Video viewers (25%+ completion)

**Exclusions (critical):**
- Existing customers (don't waste budget)
- Current employees (auto-suggested)
- Recent converters (last 30 days)

**Lookalike audiences:**
- Minimum source: 300 members
- Best source: Converted customers, not just visitors
- Expansion: Start with 10% (most similar), test 15-20% for scale

## 4. Ad Format Selection

### Format Decision Matrix

**Objective: Awareness**
→ Video Ad (15-30 seconds) if you have video assets
→ Carousel Ad (3-5 cards) if multiple images/stats
→ Single Image Ad if neither

**Objective: Consideration**
→ Document Ad if promoting PDF/whitepaper (under 10MB)
→ Carousel if previewing content/features
→ Video for demos/case studies

**Objective: Conversion**
→ Lead Gen Form (lowest friction, pre-filled data, 2-3x better than landing pages)
→ Message Ad for high-value accounts (personalized feel)
→ Single Image → Landing Page if you need custom form fields

**Objective: Remarketing**
→ Message Ad (personalized to prior engagement)
→ Lead Gen Form (high-intent warm audience)

### Creative Specifications (Quick Reference)

| Format | Image Size | File Limit | Headline | Description |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Single Image | 1200x627px | 5MB | 70 chars | 150 chars |
| Carousel (per card) | 1080x1080px | 5MB | 45 chars | 255 chars |
| Video | 1080x1080 or 1920x1080 | 200MB | - | 255 chars intro |
| Lead Gen Form | - | - | 60 chars | Auto-fill enabled |
| Message Ad | - | - | 60 chars subject | 500-700 chars body |

### Copy Principles

1. **Value prop first** (outcome, not features)
   - Bad: "Our software has 50 features"
   - Good: "Reduce reporting time by 30%"

2. **Speak to pain directly**
   - Format: "Struggling with X?"
   - Example: "Struggling with inconsistent client flow?"

3. **Be concise** (executives scan, don't read)
   - Headline: 25-50 characters optimal
   - Description: 70-100 characters optimal

4. **Use social proof** (names, numbers, awards)
   - Weak: "Our clients see great results"
   - Strong: "Acme Corp increased pipeline by 3.2x in 90 days"

5. **Specific CTAs**
   - Generic: "Learn More"
   - Specific: "Download Guide," "Book Demo," "Get Case Study"

## 6. Bidding Strategy

### Start: Automated Bidding (Always)

**Week 1-2: Maximum Delivery (Learning Phase)**
- Let LinkedIn's algorithm explore bid landscape
- Expect CPL 50-100% above target (normal)
- Don't panic and change everything after 2 days

**What to monitor:**
- Budget utilization (should spend 80-100% daily)
- Delivery warnings ("Low Delivery" after Day 5 = issue)
- Minimum conversions: 10-15 per week for algorithm to learn

### When to Switch to Manual

**After 14 days, if CPL consistently >30% above target:**

**For Lead Gen/Traffic campaigns → Manual CPC:**
- Set bid at LOW end of suggested range
- Monitor for 2-3 days
- If "Low Delivery" → increase 15-20%
- If CPL still high → decrease 10-15%

**For Awareness campaigns → Manual CPM:**
- Set bid at MID-POINT of suggested range
- Optimize for reach, not clicks

**Alternative: Cost Cap**
- Set maximum CPL you'll pay (e.g., $100)
- LinkedIn optimizes within constraint
- Trade-off: May limit delivery volume

### Bid Adjustment Rules

**INCREASE bid 15-20% when:**
- "Low Delivery" for 3+ consecutive days
- Audience >50K but underspending
- Need more volume, can afford slightly higher CPL

**DECREASE bid 10-15% when:**
- CPL below target for 7+ days (overpaying)
- More leads than sales can handle

**KEEP STABLE when:**
- CPL within ±10% of target
- Lead quality strong (>15% to opportunity)
- **Never change bids more than once per week**

## 7. Lead Magnet Funnel

### The 3V Rule for Lead Magnets

Every B2B lead magnet must satisfy:

**1. Value** (Actionable Immediately)
- Prospect can apply learnings within 24 hours
- Templates, checklists, frameworks, calculators
- Not: Generic advice or theory

**2. Velocity** (Fast to Consume)
- Under 10 minutes to read/watch
- 2,000-2,500 words max or 5-minute video
- Skimmable: bullet points, numbered steps, bold headers

**3. Vision** (Creates Desire for Full Solution)
- Tease the "what" without fully revealing the "how"
- Show what's possible, make them want help achieving it
- End with CTA: "Want help implementing? Book a call"

### Promotion: Comment-to-DM Strategy

**LinkedIn Post Structure:**
- Hook (1-2 lines): "This funnel booked 40 calls last week—here's how"
- Body (3-5 lines): Tease 2-3 insights inside lead magnet
- CTA: "Comment 'GUIDE' and I'll send it to you"

**Why this works:**
- Comments boost post reach 2x (algorithm rewards engagement)
- Qualifies leads (only engaged people comment)
- Avoids link penalty (LinkedIn deprioritizes posts with external links)

**DM within 1 hour:**
```
Hey [Name],
Here's the [Lead Magnet] I mentioned!
Grab it here: [Landing Page Link]
Let me know what you think.
```

### Landing Page (Minimal Friction)

**Components:**
- Headline: "Access the B2B LinkedIn Growth Blueprint (Free)"
- Bullet list: 5-7 specific takeaways
- Form: First name + email ONLY (each field = 10% conversion drop)
- CTA button: "Access Now" / "Send Me the Guide"
- Social proof: Testimonial snippet or usage stat

**Conversion benchmark:** 35-60% opt-in rate

### Offer Page (Immediate Redirect)

**After opt-in, redirect to:**
- Headline: "Before you go—see how we help [audience] get [outcome]"
- 2-5 minute VSL (Video Sales Letter):
  - 0:00-0:30: Hook
  - 0:30-3:00: Your methodology + proof
  - 3:00-5:00: CTA to book strategy call
- CTA button: "Book Your Strategy Call"

**Conversion benchmark:** 15-25% click-to-call rate

---

## 8. Optimization Cadence

### Daily (15 minutes)
- Budget pacing: Spending evenly?
- Cost metrics: CPL within 10% of target?
- Delivery issues: Any "Low Delivery" warnings?
- Quick wins: Pause ads with CTR <0.15% for 3+ days

### Weekly (60 minutes)
- Compare campaigns: Top 20% vs. bottom 20%
- Creative performance: Which ads have CTR >campaign average?
- Budget reallocation: Move $ from low ROI to high ROI
- A/B test results: 1,000+ impressions per variant? Declare winner.

### Monthly (2-3 hours)
- Funnel analysis: Where do drop-offs occur?
- Creative fatigue check: CTR declined >20%?
- Audience insights: Unexpected demographics performing?
- Strategic adjustments: Should objectives/budgets shift?

### Kill Criteria (Pause Immediately If)

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| CTR collapse | <0.15% for 5+ days, 5K+ impressions | Pause within 24 hours |
| CPL explosion | >2x target for 7+ days | Pause within 48 hours |
| Zero conversions | $500+ spend, 100+ clicks | Pause immediately |
| Lead quality collapse | <30% qualified for 10+ leads | Pause within 24 hours |
