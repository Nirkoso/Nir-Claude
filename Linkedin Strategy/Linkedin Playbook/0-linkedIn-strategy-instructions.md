## 🧭 Core Principles (Apply Across All Files)

### The Non-Negotiables:

1. **70/20/10 Budget Model**
   - 70% Core Offer (conversion)
   - 20% Brand Awareness
   - 10% Remarketing (nearly halves CPL)

2. **2-3 Targeting Criteria Maximum**
   - More than 3 = audience too small
   - Fewer than 2 = too broad

3. **50K-500K Audience Sweet Spot**
   - Below 50K = poor delivery
   - Above 500K = low relevance

4. **30% Weekly Scaling Rule**
   - Never increase budget >30% per week
   - Doubling resets algorithm (CPL spike)

5. **Value-First Philosophy**
   - Don't pitch, help
   - Lead magnets solve real problems
   - Test organically before paid amplification

### The Frameworks:

- **7-Hour Rule:** B2B needs 7 hours of interaction to build trust
- **3V Rule:** Lead magnets need Value, Velocity, Vision
- **Comment-to-DM:** Boosts reach 2x, qualifies leads
- **Multi-channel stability:** Avoid "one-legged stool" dependency

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**You're using these files correctly if:**

- ✅ Campaign strategies cite specific frameworks (70/20/10, 2-3 criteria)
- ✅ Benchmarks are industry-specific (not generic B2B)
