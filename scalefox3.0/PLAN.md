4. Messaging framework and copy guidelines
5. Consolidated product specification document

## Success Criteria

- Screen states, interactions, and transitions defined
- Copy and messaging aligned with hand-held, empowering tone
- Campaign planning logic clearly explained
- Technical requirements and data flows specified
