## What NOT to Do (Common Mistakes)

### Week 1 Pitfalls
- ❌ Don't panic at high CPL ($300-500 is normal)
- ❌ Don't optimize before Day 7
- ❌ Don't combine 5+ targeting criteria
- ❌ Don't start with $200/day budget

### Weeks 2-4 Pitfalls
- ❌ Don't change everything at once (change 1 variable at a time)
- ❌ Don't ignore lead quality (volume ≠ success)
- ❌ Don't skip retargeting (it's your cheapest leads)
- ❌ Don't set and forget (daily checks are essential)

### Budget Pitfalls
- ❌ Don't blow entire budget in Week 1
- ❌ Don't deploy reserve until you've proven success
- ❌ Don't scale by 200% overnight (30-50% max)

---

## Emergency Playbooks

### Scenario 1: $500 spent, 0 leads
**Likely Cause:** Targeting too narrow or creative isn't resonating

**Fix:**
1. Check audience size (expand if <50K)
2. Test new ad with stronger value prop
3. Simplify lead form (reduce fields to 3-4)
4. Pause campaign for 24h, relaunch with changes

---

### Scenario 2: Lots of leads, all unqualified
**Likely Cause:** Targeting too broad or offer attracts wrong audience

**Fix:**
1. Narrow targeting (add seniority filter, specific company sizes)
2. Update ad copy to call out ICP specifically
3. Add qualifying question to lead form
4. Adjust offer (make it more specific to your ICP)

---

### Scenario 3: CTR dropping week over week
**Likely Cause:** Ad fatigue

**Fix:**
1. Check frequency (if >3.5, pause ad for refresh)
2. Create 2-3 new ad variants with different hooks
3. Test new imagery (faces, product screenshots, data viz)
4. Expand audience to reduce frequency

---

### Scenario 4: CPL increasing week over week
**Likely Cause:** Audience saturation or declining creative performance

**Fix:**
1. Refresh creative (new hooks, new images)
2. Expand audience (lookalike or new job titles)
3. Increase retargeting budget (cheaper CPL)
4. Test new campaign objective (switch from clicks to conversions)

---

## Month 2 Planning Guide

### If Month 1 was SUCCESSFUL (CPL <$150, 5+ qualified demos):
**Strategy:** Scale winners, expand audience

- Increase budget to $5K-7K
- Launch lookalike audiences based on converters
- Test new creative angles (2-3 new variants)
- Add video content
- Expand to new geographies or industries

---

### If Month 1 was ACCEPTABLE (CPL $150-200, 3-5 demos):
**Strategy:** Optimize before scaling

- Keep budget at $3K
- Focus on creative refresh (5-10 new ads)
- Test Lead Gen Forms vs. landing pages
- Narrow targeting to best-performing segments
- Double down on retargeting (20% → 30% of budget)

---

### If Month 1 was UNDERPERFORMING (CPL >$200, <3 demos):
**Strategy:** Pause and diagnose

- Reduce budget to $1.5K
- Deep audit: Is the offer right? Is the ICP right?
- Test dramatically different creative approaches
- Consider switching from LinkedIn ads to organic content
- Evaluate if LinkedIn is the right channel for this ICP
