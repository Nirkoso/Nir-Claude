## Key Insights for Product Design

**1. Automate the Intimidating**
- Users fear what they don't know. Automate competitor analysis, persona generation, and brand extraction to remove blank-canvas paralysis.

**2. Educate Through Action**
- Don't just tell them how LinkedIn ads work - show them while they build. Every step should teach a concept.

**3. Celebrate Progress Frequently**
- First-time advertisers need validation. Celebrate after every step, first lead, Week 1 completion, etc.

**4. Manage Expectations Proactively**
- The biggest drop-off risk is Days 1-3 slow results. Over-communicate that this is normal via daily emails.

**5. Make Optimization Feel Easy**
- Week 1 review should feel like "apply these 3 recommendations" not "figure out what to do next".

**6. Build Community**
- Peer success stories reduce anxiety. "Sarah from a similar company got 8 leads in Week 1" is powerful social proof.

**7. Safety Nets Everywhere**
- First-time advertisers need to know they can't break anything. "Pause anytime", "You approve before we publish", "We'll guide you".
