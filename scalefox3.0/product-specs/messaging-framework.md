# Scalefox 3.0: Messaging Framework & Copy Guidelines

**Product:** Scalefox 3.0 - Hand-Held LinkedIn Advertising Platform
**Created:** 2025-12-03
**Agents:** copywriter, conversion-optimizer

---

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Voice Attributes

**Scalefox speaks as:**
- **The Expert Friend** - Knowledgeable but never condescending
- **The Empowering Guide** - "You can do this, and here's how"
- **The Transparent Advisor** - Honest about challenges and realistic about outcomes
- **The Confidence Builder** - Celebrates every win, normalizes every setback

**Not:**
- Corporate and cold
- Overly technical or jargon-heavy
- Hype-driven or making unrealistic promises
- Patronizing or dumbing down

---

## Tone Spectrum by Context

### Educational Content (Steps 1-6, Dashboard Tooltips)

**Tone:** Warm, clear, slightly informal

**Characteristics:**
- Use analogies and metaphors
- "Explain like I'm smart but new"
- Active voice, second person ("you'll")
- Short sentences for clarity

**Example - Good:**
"Think of your warm-up campaign like a first date - you don't propose marriage right away. Week 1 is about learning what your audience likes."

**Example - Avoid:**
"The warm-up campaign facilitates algorithm learning through limited initial budget deployment to optimize delivery efficiency."

---

### Motivational Content (Progress Updates, Celebrations)

**Tone:** Enthusiastic, validating, energizing

**Characteristics:**
- Exclamation points (but not excessive)
- Direct affirmation ("You did it!", "Great work!")
- Specific praise (not generic "good job")
- Forward momentum ("Next up:", "Now let's:")

**Example - Good:**
"You just created 6 professional ads in 20 minutes. That's what agencies charge $2,000 for. Nice work!"

**Example - Avoid:**
"Tasks completed successfully. Please proceed to next step."

---

### Reassurance Content (Anxiety Moments, Setbacks)

**Tone:** Calm, normalizing, supportive

**Characteristics:**
- Start with acknowledgment ("We know this feels...")
- Normalize the concern ("This is completely normal")
- Provide data/proof ("85% of campaigns start this way")
- Offer concrete next step

**Example - Good:**
"Only 50 impressions on Day 1? That's completely normal. Most campaigns start slow while LinkedIn learns your audience. Check back tomorrow - you'll see momentum building."

**Example - Avoid:**
"Low delivery detected. Adjust targeting parameters to improve performance."

---

### Technical Explanations (How Things Work)

**Tone:** Clear, jargon-free (or jargon explained), practical

**Characteristics:**
- Define terms inline ("CTR (click-through rate)")
- Use "what this means for you" framing
- Provide benchmarks for context
- Actionable takeaways

**Example - Good:**
"Click-Through Rate (CTR) is the percentage of people who saw your ad and clicked. B2B average: 0.35-0.50%. Your current: 0.48% - you're doing great! Higher CTR means your message is resonating."

**Example - Avoid:**
"CTR metric indicates ad relevance coefficient relative to target audience engagement propensity."

---

### Onboarding (Steps 1-4: Discovery & Strategy)

**Key Messages by Step:**

**Step 1 (Enter URL):**
- Headline: "Let's start with the basics - what's your company website?"
- Subheadline: "We'll analyze your site to understand your business, industry, and ideal customers (takes about 30 seconds)"
- Reassurance: "Don't worry, we won't change anything on your site - just reading"
- Progress: "Great! Here's what we found:" [validation of data]

**Step 2 (Competitors):**
- Headline: "Who are your main competitors?"
- Subheadline: "We'll analyze their LinkedIn campaigns to see what's working (and where you can stand out)"
- Reassurance: "Can't find them? Add manually:" / "I don't know my competitors" [skip option]
- Insight: "Interesting! Most of your competitors focus on [theme]. Let's use a different angle to stand out"

**Step 3 (Personas):**
- Headline: "Who should see your ads?"
- Subheadline: "Based on your company and competitors, here are the people most likely to buy from you"
- Education: "Think of personas like customer avatars - the more specific, the better your ads perform"
- Validation: "Perfect! This audience size is ideal for your budget" [50K-500K range]
- Warning (if too narrow): "This targeting is too narrow. Try broadening slightly"

**Step 4 (Brand Profile):**
- Headline: "Let's make your ads sound like YOU (not a robot)"

- Education: "Your brand is what makes you different. Let's showcase that in your ads"

---

### Strategy & Planning (Steps 5-6: Campaign Plan & Playbook)

**Key Messages by Step:**

**Step 5 (Campaign Planning):**
- Headline: "Let's build your custom campaign plan"
- Subheadline: "Based on your budget, we'll show you exactly what to expect week-by-week"

**Warm-Up Campaign Explanation:**
"Think of this like a first date - we're not proposing marriage yet, just seeing what clicks. Week 1 teaches LinkedIn's algorithm who your best customers are."

**Budget Allocation (70/20/10) Explanation:**
"This is the battle-tested formula from analyzing $10M+ in LinkedIn ad spend. We tested other splits (50/30/20, 80/10/10) - this one wins every time."

**Retargeting Explanation:**
"Remember window shoppers? We'll show them a special offer to come back. They already know you, so they're more likely to buy. Real talk: This is the highest ROI activity in LinkedIn advertising."

**Projected Results Framing:**
"What can you expect? (Based on B2B averages)
- Month 1: 35-65 qualified leads
- Cost per lead: $77-143
- Time to first lead: 3-5 days

Important: These are estimates. Your actual results depend on offer quality, ad creative, and competition. We'll optimize based on YOUR real data starting Week 2."

**Step 6 (GTM Playbook):**
- Headline: "Here's your go-to-market strategy (based on real market data)"
- Subheadline: "We analyzed your competitors and ideal customers to create 6 proven ad concepts"

**Brief Intro:**
"Strategy: We'll leverage their proven patterns AND attack their weaknesses."

**Why 6 Briefs:**
"Why 6 briefs? Because diverse creative approaches let the market tell you what works. Briefs 1-3 are safer bets (based on competitor success). Briefs 4-6 are higher-risk/higher-reward (creative angles your competitors aren't using)."

**Empowerment Message:**
"This playbook is the result of analyzing 1,000+ successful B2B campaigns. You're getting expert-level strategy without paying for an agency."

---

### Execution (Steps 7-8: Create & Publish)

**Key Messages by Step:**

**Step 7 (Create Ads):**
- Headline: "Let's bring your ads to life"

**During Creation:**
- Encouragement: "Looking good! Your first ad is 80% done - just add a headline"
- Education: "Why 6 ads? Testing multiple angles is how we find winners. You'll see which one performs best in Week 1"
- Reassurance: "Stuck? Click 'Generate variations' and let AI help. You can always edit after"
- Celebration: "Great! Ad 1 complete. [●●○○○○]" / "You just created an ad that marketing agencies would charge $500 for. Nice work"

**Step 8 (Publish):**
- Headline: "You're 2 clicks away from launching your campaign"
- Subheadline: "Review everything below, then connect your LinkedIn account to publish"

**Pre-Publish Reassurance:**
- "Nothing is live until YOU click 'Activate' in LinkedIn. You're in control"
- "You can pause anytime in LinkedIn Campaign Manager"
- "We've done 90% of the work. LinkedIn just needs your approval before spending your budget"

**What Happens Next:**
"After connecting:
• We'll create campaign drafts (takes 2-3 minutes)
• You'll receive an email with next steps
• You'll review everything in LinkedIn Campaign Manager before going live"

**Post-Publish:**
"Your campaigns are now in LinkedIn Campaign Manager. Look for: 'Scalefox - Month 1' campaign group. Status: Draft (not yet active). Click 'Activate' for the Warm-Up Week campaign. Your ads will go live within 15 minutes."

---

### Success & Monitoring (Steps 9-10: Confirmation & Dashboard)

**Key Messages:**

**Step 9 (Success Screen):**
- Headline: "You did it! Your first LinkedIn campaign is LIVE."
- Celebration: "You built a professional LinkedIn campaign from scratch. That's a $5K-10K agency deliverable - and you did it yourself"

**What to Expect (Day-by-Day):**
"Day 1 (Today): First impressions within 2-4 hours, first clicks within 4-8 hours. Algorithm starts learning.

Days 2-3: Expect 100-300 impressions/day, 2-8 clicks/day. LinkedIn's algorithm is still learning.

Days 4-7: Impressions accelerate (300-500/day), 8-15 clicks/day, first leads likely. Algorithm optimization kicks in.

Expected Week 1 Results: 2,000-3,500 impressions, 40-80 clicks, 3-6 leads, cost per lead $35-70. These are LEARNING metrics. Week 2-4 will be better."

**Managing Expectations:**
"Week 1 will feel slow. That's by design. The algorithm is learning. Week 2 is where the magic happens."

**Step 10 (Dashboard):**
- Status Messages:
  - "Active and delivering well ✓"
  - "On track ✓" [budget pacing]
  - "Above average ✓" [CTR comparison]
  - "Within target range ✓" [CPL comparison]

**Insights Framing:**
- "Your best ad focuses on results/ROI. Action: Create 2 more ads with this angle for Week 2"
- "Your audience: 68% VP-level, 32% Director-level. Insight: VP-level has 2x conversion rate (consider focusing targeting)"
- "Peak engagement times: 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM EST. Tip: Your ads show more during these hours (LinkedIn optimizes automatically)"

**Educational Tooltips:**
"Click-Through Rate (CTR): The percentage of people who saw your ad and clicked. B2B average: 0.35-0.50%. Your current: 0.48% ✓ Good! Higher CTR means more relevant targeting, compelling ad creative, and strong value proposition. How to improve: Test new headlines, use faces in images, add social proof."

## Anxiety Management Copy Patterns

### Common User Anxieties & Responses

**Anxiety: "Is this working? I don't see results yet" (Days 1-3)**

Response Pattern:
1. Acknowledge: "Only [X] impressions on Day [Y]?"
2. Normalize: "That's completely normal."
3. Provide context: "Most campaigns start slow while LinkedIn learns your audience."
4. Set expectation: "Check back tomorrow - you'll see momentum building."
5. Benchmark: "85% of campaigns have <100 clicks in first 48 hours."

**Anxiety: "Did I mess something up?" (Low performance)**

Response Pattern:
1. Diagnose: "Low CTR detected. Here's what this usually means..."
2. Explain: "Your targeting might be too broad, or the message isn't resonating yet."
3. No blame: "This is normal in the testing phase - it's why we test multiple ads."
4. Action: "Try this: Pause this ad and increase budget to your top performer."
5. Reassure: "We'll learn and optimize. That's the whole point of Week 1."

**Anxiety: "Should I change something?" (Temptation to over-optimize)**

Response Pattern:
1. Stop: "Hold up - don't change anything yet."
2. Explain why: "Your campaign is still in the learning phase (Days 1-7). Changes reset the algorithm."
3. Set expectation: "Wait until Day 7. We'll give you specific recommendations then."
4. Provide proxy action: "In the meantime, watch which ads get more engagement. That's valuable intel for Week 2."

**Anxiety: "This is more expensive than I thought" (High CPL early)**

Response Pattern:
1. Validate: "Week 1 CPL: $85. You expected $50-75."
2. Contextualize: "Week 1 is always more expensive - the algorithm is still learning who to target."
3. Provide proof: "85% of campaigns see CPL drop 30-50% by Week 3."
4. Show trend: "Your CPL has already dropped from $120 (Day 1) to $85 (Day 4). It's improving."
5. Commit: "If it's still above $100 on Day 14, we'll help you adjust targeting."

## Educational Content Templates

### Tooltip Template

```
[Concept Name]: ?

"[Simple definition in one sentence]

[Context - industry average or benchmark]
Your current: [User's metric] [Status indicator]

[Why it matters - 1-2 sentences]

How to improve:
• [Actionable tip 1]
• [Actionable tip 2]
• [Actionable tip 3]

[Learn More link]"
```

**Example:**
```
Cost Per Lead (CPL): ?

"The average amount you pay for each lead.

B2B LinkedIn average: $50-150
Your current: $85 ✓ Good!

Lower CPL means you can generate more leads with the same budget, or spend less to hit your lead volume targets.

How to improve:
• Simplify your form (fewer fields = higher conversion)
• Test lead gen forms instead of landing pages
• Exclude converting audiences from new campaigns

[Learn More]"
```

### Expandable Education Template

```
▼ [Question User Might Ask]

[Analogy or simple explanation - 2-3 sentences]

[Why it matters - 1 sentence]

[Real example with specific data]

[Key takeaway - 1 sentence]
```

**Example:**
```
▼ What's a "warm-up campaign"?

Think of LinkedIn's ad algorithm like a self-driving car - it needs to learn your route before it can drive efficiently.

In Week 1, we're teaching the algorithm who clicks your ads, who converts, what times work best, and what messages resonate.

If you skip this and go straight to high spend, you'll waste money while the algorithm figures it out.

Real example: Companies that warm up see 40-60% lower cost per lead by Week 3.

Key takeaway: Patience in Week 1 = better results in Weeks 2-4.
```

## Tone Examples by Situation

### Positive Performance

**Situation:** User's CTR is above average

**Bad:** "Your CTR is 0.52%, which is above the industry standard of 0.35-0.50%."

**Good:** "Your CTR is 0.52% - that's excellent! You're beating the B2B average of 0.40%. Your ads are resonating."

**Great:** "Nice! Your CTR is 0.52%, which puts you in the top 25% of B2B advertisers. Your message is clearly clicking with your audience. Keep this up."

---

### Negative Performance

**Situation:** User's ad has very low CTR

**Bad:** "Warning: Ad performance below acceptable threshold. Immediate action required."

**Good:** "This ad has a CTR of 0.12%, which is below average (0.35% typical). Consider pausing it and reallocating budget to better performers."

**Great:** "This ad isn't getting much traction - 0.12% CTR when we'd expect 0.35%+. No worries, this is why we test! Pause this one and put that budget toward your winner. Want help creating a new ad? [Create Similar to Top Performer]"

---

### Complex Explanation Needed

**Situation:** Explaining why retargeting costs less

**Bad:** "Retargeting campaigns leverage pre-qualified audience segments with established brand awareness, resulting in reduced acquisition costs and improved conversion efficiency."

**Good:** "Retargeting costs less because you're advertising to people who already know who you are. They've seen your first ad or visited your website. It's like the difference between cold calling a stranger vs calling a warm lead - way more efficient."

**Great:** "Remember how I said retargeting is your secret weapon? Here's why: These people already clicked your ad or visited your site. They know who you are. So when they see your retargeting ad, it's like running into someone you met at a party - way less awkward than a cold intro. That's why it costs 50% less and converts 3x better."

---

### User is Confused/Frustrated

**Situation:** User doesn't understand why they need to wait until Day 7 to optimize

**Bad:** "Algorithm learning phase requires minimum 7-day observation period before statistically significant optimizations can be implemented."

**Good:** "We know you want to jump in and start tweaking, but changing things before Day 7 actually hurts performance. The algorithm is still learning who your best audience is. Let it finish learning, then we'll optimize based on real data."

**Great:** "I get it - you want to start optimizing NOW. But here's the thing: changing your campaign before Day 7 is like interrupting someone mid-sentence. The algorithm is still figuring out who your best customers are. If we change things now, it has to start over. Trust me on this - wait until Day 7, and we'll give you specific, data-backed recommendations. Your patience will pay off."

## Messaging Don'ts

- Make unrealistic promises ("Guaranteed 100 leads in Week 1")
- Be overly formal ("Please proceed to the subsequent step")

- Over-use emojis (1-2 max per screen, strategic placement)
- Say "just" or "simply" when something is actually complex
- Use passive voice ("Your campaign has been created")
- Generic encouragement ("Good job!", "Well done!")

**✓ Do:**
- Explain terms inline ("CTR (click-through rate)")
- Set realistic expectations with ranges ("35-65 leads")
- Be conversational ("Let's build your campaign")
- Focus on user's opportunity ("Here's where you can stand out")
- Use emojis sparingly for celebration or emphasis
- Be honest about complexity ("This step requires thinking")
