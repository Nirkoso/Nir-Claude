## Budget Breakdown

|------------|--------|---|---------|
| Testing | $750 | 30% | 6 ad sets @ $125 each |
| Optimizing | $875 | 35% | Winners + variants |
| Scaling | $750 | 30% | Proven formula |
| Reserve | $125 | 5% | Opportunities |
| **Total** | **$2,500** | **100%** | |

**Daily Pacing:**
- Test Phase: $107/day
- Optimize Phase: $62/day
- Scale Phase: $94/day

## Testing Strategy

**Primary Hypothesis:** "Problem-solution messaging focusing on 'time saved' will outperform testimonial and data-driven approaches for time-starved VP marketers"

**Why:** ICP data shows primary pain is "manual proposal process takes too long" - directly addressing this should resonate.

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Scale:** CPL < $100, CTR > 0.8%, min 5 conversions
- **Optimize:** CPL $100-150, CTR 0.5-0.8%, shows promise
- **Pause:** CPL > $150, CTR < 0.5%, or zero conversions after $200 spend

**Expected Timeline to Significance:**
- 7 days minimum per concept
- ~100-150 clicks per variant
- ~5-8 conversions per variant at $75 avg CPL

## Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Conversions:** 30-35 demo requests (Target: 33)
- **CPL:** $71-75 (Target: <$75)
- **Conversion Rate:** >2.5%

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **CTR:** >1.0% (indicates message resonance)
- **Engagement Rate:** >3% (social proof)
- **Frequency:** <3.5 (avoid fatigue)

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- **Budget Utilization:** >90%
- **Phase Transitions:** On schedule
- **ROAS:** >3:1 (assuming $1,500 ACV)

## Key Milestones

| Date | Milestone | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Feb 7 | Test phase complete | Min 1 concept with CPL <$100 |
| Feb 8 | Select winners | Clear statistical leader identified |
| Feb 14 | Mid-optimize check | CPL trending toward <$75 |
| Feb 21 | Optimize complete | Consistent sub-$75 CPL achieved |
| Feb 22 | Scale phase launch | Winner validated, ready for volume |
| Feb 29 | Campaign complete | 30+ conversions, learnings documented |

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Test phase doesn't produce clear winner
**Mitigation:** Extend test +3 days using reserve budget, or pivot to best performer even if marginal

**Risk:** CPL exceeds $100 across all concepts
**Mitigation:** Pause after $500 spend, review ICP targeting accuracy, potentially pivot to different personas or revise targeting

**Risk:** Audience fatigue (frequency >4)
**Mitigation:** Creative refresh prepared for Day 21, expand audience by 30% if needed

## Next Steps

**Before Launch (By Jan 31):**
1. Create 3 concept creatives using Brief Maker + Creative Prompter
2. Set up conversion tracking (LinkedIn Insight Tag on demo thank-you page)
3. Create 6 ad sets in LinkedIn Campaign Manager with targeting specified above
4. Set daily budget to $107, bid strategy to "Maximum Delivery"
5. Install frequency cap: 3 impressions per 30 days

**Week 1 (Feb 1-7):**
1. Monitor daily for delivery issues
2. Verify conversions are tracking correctly
3. Check performance every evening

**Day 7 (Feb 7):**
1. Pull performance data for all 6 ad sets
2. Run statistical significance test
3. Select top 2 performers for optimize phase
4. Prepare headline variations for testing

**Ongoing:**
- Document all learnings in test log
- Flag anomalies to Monitor Agent
- Update ICP Agent with persona performance data
