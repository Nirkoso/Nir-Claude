# LinkedIn Ads Best Practices

## Targeting Best Practices

### Job Titles
✅ **Do:** Use 6-15 specific titles
✅ **Do:** Include variations (VP Marketing, VP of Marketing, Chief Marketing Officer)
✅ **Do:** Mix seniority levels (Director + VP)

❌ **Don't:** Use overly broad titles ("Manager")
❌ **Don't:** Exceed 20 titles (too diluted)

### Audience Size
- **Minimum:** 50,000 (below this, delivery struggles)
- **Optimal:** 100,000-500,000
- **Maximum:** 1M+ (too broad, efficiency suffers)

**If too small:** Expand to related titles or additional geos
**If too large:** Add company size or seniority filters

## Creative Best Practices

- **Format:** PNG or JPEG
- **Size:** Max 5MB
- **Dimensions:** 1200×627 (1.91:1 ratio) or 1200×1200 (1:1 square)
- **Resolution:** Minimum 1080p

### Text on Image
- **Maximum:** 20% of image area

## Bidding Best Practices

### Bid Strategy

**Starting Out (Days 1-7):**
- Use "Maximum Delivery"
- Accept LinkedIn's suggested bid
- Let algorithm optimize

**After 7 Days:**
- Switch to "Manual CPC" if you want more control
- Start at suggested bid, adjust based on results

### Bid Adjustments
- **Underdelivering:** Increase bid 15-20%
- **Overspending/High CPL:** Decrease bid 10-15%
- **Adjust gradually:** Don't change more than 20% at once

---

## Frequency Management

### Optimal Frequency
- **Week 1:** 1.0-2.0 (building awareness)
- **Week 2-3:** 2.0-3.5 (maintaining presence)
- **Week 4+:** Keep under 4.0

### When Frequency Exceeds 4.0:
1. Expand audience targeting (+20-30% size)
2. Refresh creative
3. Reduce daily budget temporarily
4. Implement frequency cap (3-4 impressions per 30 days)

---

## Scheduling Best Practices

### Best Days
**B2B:** Tuesday-Thursday (highest engagement)
**Avoid:** Fridays after 2 PM, Sundays

### Best Times (EST)
**Morning:** 7-9 AM (commute, coffee time)
**Midday:** 12-1 PM (lunch scrolling)
**Afternoon:** 3-5 PM (post-meeting wind-down)

**Worst:** After 7 PM, before 6 AM

### Campaign Schedule
✅ Run 24/7 initially to gather data
✅ After 2 weeks, adjust to best-performing times
❌ Don't immediately restrict to "business hours"

---

## Lead Form Best Practices

### Form Length
- **Short:** Name, Email, Company (higher volume)
- **Medium:** +Job Title, Company Size (qualified leads)
- **Long:** +Phone, +Custom questions (highly qualified)

**Rule:** Each additional field reduces completion by ~10%

### Custom Questions
✅ Ask about: Budget, Timeline, Current solution
❌ Don't ask: Personal info, irrelevant details

### Thank You Page
- Confirm submission
- Set expectations (response time)
- Offer next step (book call, watch video)

---

## Budget & Pacing

### Daily Budget
**Calculation:**
```
Daily Budget = Monthly Budget / 30 days × 1.2
```
*The 1.2 multiplier accounts for variation*

**Example:** $3,000/month = $100/day × 1.2 = $120 daily budget

### Budget Alerts
Set alerts at:
- 50% spent (mid-month check)
- 80% spent (scaling decision)
- 100% spent (campaign ending)

---

## Conversion Tracking

### Must Track
1. **Lead form submissions** (native LinkedIn tracking)
2. **Landing page conversions** (via Insight Tag)
3. **CRM conversions** (if possible)

### Insight Tag Placement
Place on:
- Thank you pages
- Demo request confirmation
- All key conversion pages

### UTM Parameters
Always use:
```
utm_source=linkedin
utm_medium=paid_social
utm_campaign=[campaign_name]
utm_content=[ad_name]
utm_term=[audience_name]
```
