|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Spend** | $210 | $700 | $770 | $805 | **$2,485** |
| **Impressions** | 35K | 120K | 135K | 145K | **435K** |
| **Clicks** | 140 | 480 | 540 | 580 | **1,740** |
| **CTR** | 0.40% | 0.40% | 0.40% | 0.40% | **0.40%** |
| **Leads** | 3 | 7 | 9 | 10 | **29** |
| **CPL** | $70 | $100 | $86 | $81 | **$86** |
| **CPC** | $1.50 | $1.46 | $1.43 | $1.39 | **$1.43** |

**Blended CPL Target:** $80-120
**Total Leads (Conservative):** 25-35
**Total Leads (Optimistic):** 35-50 (if retargeting performs well)

### Key Assumptions:
- CTR stabilizes at 0.35-0.45% (industry avg for B2B lead gen)
- Lead form completion rate: 40-50%
- Retargeting CPL is 40% lower than cold traffic ($50-60)
- 10-15% of leads will be low-quality (wrong titles, competitors)

### Lead Quality Breakdown (Expected):
- **Tier 1 (High Intent):** 40% → 10-14 leads (Director+ at target companies, opened form immediately)
- **Tier 2 (Medium Intent):** 40% → 10-14 leads (Right title, slower engagement)
- **Tier 3 (Low Quality):** 20% → 5-7 leads (Wrong fit, curious clickers)

**Sales Handoff:**
Expect 10-15 sales-qualified leads (SQLs) from the 29 total. Book rate to demo: 40-60% = 4-9 demos booked.

---

## Success Metrics (Track Weekly)

### Primary KPIs:
1. **Cost Per Lead (CPL):** Target <$120, stretch goal <$90
2. **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Target >0.35%
3. **Lead Form Completion Rate:** Target >40%
4. **Total Leads:** Target 25-35

### Secondary KPIs:

6. **Frequency:** Keep <3.0 (avoid audience burnout)
7. **Engagement Rate (Brand Awareness):** Target >2%
8. **Retargeting CPL:** Should be 30-50% lower than cold

### Lead Quality Metrics (Sales Team Feedback):

10. **Demo Book Rate:** % of SQLs that book a demo (target 40-60%)
11. **Response Rate:** % of leads that reply to outreach (target 25-40%)

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- CPL >$150 for 3+ days in a row → pause and adjust
- CTR <0.25% → creative is failing, test new hooks
- Lead form completion <30% → form is too long or CTA mismatch
- Frequency >4.0 → audience exhausted, expand or pause

## Hand-Holding Tips for First-Time Advertisers

### Week 1 Nerves (Common Fears):
**"My ads aren't spending!"**
- Normal. LinkedIn ramps slowly. Give it 48 hours.
- Check bid strategy: use "Maximum Delivery" for first week.

**"My CPL is $300!"**
- Don't panic on Day 1-2. Algorithm needs 3-5 days to optimize.
- If still high after 7 days, pause and adjust targeting.

**"I got 2 leads but they're junk."**
- Add job title validation question to lead form.
- Exclude job titles like "Student," "Intern," "Freelance."

### Mid-Campaign Confidence Boosters:
**Week 2: "Should I pause this ad?"**
- Use the rules above (CTR <0.25% or CPL >$200 after 5 leads).
- When in doubt, let it run 3 more days before deciding.

**Week 3: "My retargeting isn't spending."**
- Audience might be too small (<5,000). Expand lookback window to 90 days.
- Or: Loosen targeting (add form openers who didn't submit).

**Week 4: "I'm underspending my budget."**
- Switch to "Maximum Delivery" bid strategy.
- Expand audience (add adjacent job titles like "Growth Manager").
- Increase daily budget by 20% on winning campaigns.

---

## Next Steps After Month 1

**If CPL is $80-120 (Success):**
- Scale to $5K/month in Month 2
- Test new audience segments (job functions beyond marketing)
- Launch ABM campaign targeting specific accounts (if you have list)

**If CPL is $120-150 (Acceptable):**
- Continue at $3K/month
- Focus on creative refresh (new hooks, video testimonials)
- Improve lead form (reduce friction, test custom questions)

**If CPL is >$150 (Underperforming):**
- Pause LinkedIn, diagnose root cause
- Likely issues: targeting too narrow, weak offer, poor creative
- Consider: Free resource (ebook, webinar) instead of direct demo ask
