**Budget:** $500/month (~$16.50/day)
**Objective:** Lead Generation (Trial Signups / Demo Requests)
**Timeline:** December 2025 - January 2026
**Status:** Ready to Launch

---

## Executive Summary

This plan optimizes for a **$500/month test budget** - below Meta's ideal minimum but viable for validation with the right approach. Strategy focuses on extreme simplification, Advantage+ automation, and high creative diversity to maximize learning with limited spend.

**Expected Results:**
- **7-20 leads/month** (assuming $25-70 CPL for B2B SaaS)
- **2-3 week learning phase** (slower than normal due to budget)
- **Path to scale:** Once validated, increase to $1,500-3,000/month for optimal performance

## Campaign Structure

### Campaign 1: Scalefox - Cold Prospecting - Leads - Dec2025

**Configuration:**
- **Objective:** Leads
- **Optimization Event:** Lead (Instant Form submission)
- **Budget:** $500/month = $16.50/day
- **Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO):** ON
- **Advantage+ Campaign Budget:** ON (if available)
- **Buying Type:** Auction
- **Bid Strategy:** Highest Volume (default)

**Rationale:**
With $500/month, running 2 campaigns (prospecting + retargeting) would split budget to $12/day each - too low to exit learning phase. Single consolidated campaign maximizes data per ad set.

**Why not retargeting campaign?**
- Need minimum website traffic pool (1,000+ visitors)
- In first 30 days, prioritize building awareness and pixel data
- Month 2: Add retargeting ad set within same campaign if traffic warrants

---

## Ad Set Structure

### Ad Set 1: LAL-Founders-Broad - Primary

**Budget Allocation:** $16.50/day (100% of budget)

**Audience Configuration:**

**Geographic Targeting:**
- United States (primary)
- Canada (optional: add if US audience too small)

**Age:** 25-65 (broad)

**Gender:** All

**Advantage+ Audience:** ON ✅

**Audience Suggestions (Seeds for Algorithm):**

1. **Lookalike Audience (if available):**
   - Source: Customer email list OR website visitors (need 100+ minimum)
   - Percentage: 1% United States
   - If no data yet: Skip to interests below

2. **Interest Targeting (Broad, 2-3 max):**
   - "Entrepreneurship" (broad interest)
   - "Small Business" (broad interest)
   - "Marketing" OR "Digital Marketing" (broad interest)

   **DO NOT stack all 3** - pick 1-2 and let Advantage+ expand

3. **Optional Light Layering (B2B):**
   - Job titles: "Founder", "CEO", "Marketing Manager", "CMO", "Growth Manager"
   - Max 20-30 titles
   - Use as suggestions only with Advantage+ ON

**Exclusions:**
- Current customers (if list available)
- Your company domain (@scalefox.ai, @scalefox.com)

**Placements:**
- Advantage+ Placements: ON ✅
- Covers: Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Marketplace, Messenger, Audience Network

**Optimization & Delivery:**
- Optimization Goal: Leads
- Cost Control: None (let it run)
- Delivery Type: Standard
- Ad Scheduling: Run ads all the time

**Estimated Audience Size:** 2-5 million (should be green/broad)

**Rationale:**
- Broad targeting + Advantage+ allows algorithm maximum flexibility to find responders
- At $16.50/day, single ad set prevents budget fragmentation
- Focus on creative diversity (below) rather than audience segmentation

---

## Week-by-Week Optimization Plan

### Week 1: Launch & Monitor

**Actions:**
- ✅ Launch campaign with all 15 ads
- ✅ Install Meta Pixel
- ✅ Set up Instant Forms
- ✅ Connect CRM integration

**Monitoring (Daily):**
- Budget pacing (is it spending?)
- Delivery status (any errors?)
- Basic metrics (impressions, clicks, leads)

**Don't Change:**
- ❌ Audience settings
- ❌ Budget
- ❌ Optimization goal
- ❌ Ad creative

**Warning Signs:**
- No spend after 24 hours → Check account status, payment method
- Zero impressions → Audience too narrow (unlikely with broad setup)
- High CPM (>$40) → Audience competition issue

---

### Week 2: Data Collection

**Actions:**
- Continue monitoring
- Upload first offline conversions (if any leads qualified)
- Document which ad concepts getting most engagement

**Review Metrics:**
- Which ads have best CTR? (top 5)
- Which ads generating leads? (even if just 1-2)
- Frequency by ad (<2.0 ideal)
- CPL trend (likely still high/unstable)

**Don't Change:**
- Still in learning phase
- Let algorithm gather data

**Optional:**
- Pause bottom 3 ads if frequency >3.0 AND zero engagement

---

### Week 3: First Optimization

**Actions:**
- ✅ Identify top 5 performing ads (by CTR + leads)
- ✅ Identify bottom 5 underperformers
- ✅ Pause bottom 3-5 ads (if clear losers)
- ✅ Keep top 10 ads running

**Metric Review:**
- CPL stabilizing? (should be <$70 by now)
- Any leads converting to qualified? (upload as offline conversions)
- CTR improving? (algorithm learning)

**Changes Allowed:**
- ✅ Pause individual ads (doesn't reset learning)
- ✅ Add new ad variations (test new hooks)
- ❌ Don't change audience/budget yet

**If CPL >$80 consistently:**
- Review ad messaging (too broad? not clear value prop?)
- Check form questions (too many fields?)
- Verify tracking is working

---

### Week 4: Evaluate & Decide

**Decision Point:** Is this working?

**Success Criteria (2+ of these):**
- ✅ CPL <$70
- ✅ At least 5-10 leads
- ✅ 1-2 qualified leads
- ✅ CTR >1.0%
- ✅ "Active" status (exited learning)

**If Successful:**
- Continue current approach
- Refresh creative (add 5 new ads, remove 5 old)
- Consider small budget increase (+20% to $20/day)
- Start planning retargeting ad set for Month 2

**If Marginal (High CPL but decent quality):**
- Test form simplification (remove question 4)
- Try website conversion instead of Instant Forms
- Add more video ads (often lower CPL)
- Upload offline conversions aggressively

**If Not Working (CPL >$100, poor quality):**
- Audit: Is Meta even right channel for Scalefox?
- Review: Are ad messages clear? Do they speak to ICP pain?
- Test: Shift budget to LinkedIn ads instead? (Scalefox's core platform)
- Pivot: Try different offer (free tool, content download vs demo)

---

## Month 2 Strategy (If Month 1 Validates)

### Add Retargeting Ad Set

**Within Same Campaign:**

**Ad Set 2: Retargeting - Warm**
- Budget: $5/day (30% of total)
- Reduce Ad Set 1 to $11.50/day

**Audience:**
- Website visitors (30-90 days)
- Video viewers (50%+)
- Lead form openers (didn't submit)
- Engagement (page/post interactions)

**Creative:**
- Stronger offers (free trial, discount, case study)
- Urgency ("Limited spots this month")
- Social proof ("500+ founders trust ScaleFox")

### Creative Refresh

- Retire bottom 5 performers from Month 1
- Add 10 new concepts based on learnings
- Keep top 5 winners running
- Test new formats (reels, UGC-style)

---

## Scaling Path (When Ready)

**Prerequisites for Scaling:**
- ✅ 4+ weeks stable performance
- ✅ CPL <$60 consistently
- ✅ SQL rate >15%
- ✅ "Active" status (not Learning Limited)

**Month 2: $750/month (+50%)**
- Increase by $8/day
- Monitor for 2 weeks
- Add retargeting ad set

**Month 3: $1,000/month (+33%)**
- Now at Budget Tier 1 minimum (Playbook guidelines)
- Can add second campaign if testing new angle
- Advantage+ capabilities fully engaged

**Month 4-6: $1,500-3,000/month**
- Optimal performance zone for B2B SaaS
- Multiple ad sets viable
- Can test Advantage+ Leads campaign separately
- Creative production becomes critical

**Never:**
- ❌ Double budget overnight
- ❌ Increase >30% in single week
- ❌ Scale while in learning phase
- ❌ Scale if quality declining

---

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Budget Too Small to Exit Learning

**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** High (stuck in "Learning Limited")

**Mitigation:**
- Use single ad set (consolidate conversions)
- Optimize for "Lead" not "QualifiedLead" initially
- Be patient (3-4 weeks is normal)
- If stuck after 4 weeks, consider pausing and saving budget for 2-month launch at $1K

### Risk 2: High CPL (>$100)

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (low volume, wasted budget)

**Mitigation:**
- Test Instant Forms vs website (forms usually 20-40% cheaper)
- Simplify form (fewer questions)
- Broader targeting (remove job title layer if used)
- Better creative hooks (test 5 new ads)

### Risk 3: Low-Quality Leads

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (volume but no conversions)

**Mitigation:**
- Add qualifying form question (company size, current spend)
- Tighten ad messaging (pre-qualify in copy)
- Upload offline conversions (teach algorithm)
- Use "Higher Intent" form type

### Risk 4: Creative Fatigue (Week 3-4)

**Likelihood:** High with small budget
**Impact:** Medium (rising CPL, falling CTR)

**Mitigation:**
- Plan creative refresh for Week 4
- Have 10 backup ad concepts ready
- Rotate out bottom performers weekly
- Test new formats (reels, UGC)

### Risk 5: Wrong Channel (Meta vs LinkedIn)

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Very High (wasted budget)

**Consideration:**
- Scalefox is LinkedIn ad tool → LinkedIn might be better channel
- Meta reaches founders/marketers but less B2B-focused
- If Month 1 fails, pivot budget to LinkedIn Ads instead
- Or run parallel test: $250 Meta + $250 LinkedIn
