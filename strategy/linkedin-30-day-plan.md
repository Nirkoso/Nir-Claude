# LinkedIn 30-Day Campaign Plan | $3,000 Budget
**North Star:** Cost per qualified lead under $150

---

## KILL LIST: What NOT to Do

### Complexity Killers (Skip These Entirely)
1. **NO Video Ads Month 1** - Static images convert better for cold audiences and cost 60% less to produce
2. **NO A/B Testing Creative** - Test audiences first, creative second. One hero creative only.
3. **NO Broad Awareness Campaigns** - You can't afford brand building at $3k. Lead gen only.
4. **NO Multiple Ad Formats** - Sponsored Content only. Skip InMail, Dynamic, Carousel.
5. **NO Lookalike Audiences** - Insufficient data. Stick to firmographic targeting.
6. **NO LinkedIn Insight Tag Retargeting** - Need 300+ page visitors first. Skip until Month 2.
7. **NO Follower Campaigns** - Vanity metric. Every dollar must hunt leads.
8. **NO Manual Bidding** - Use auto-bid. You lack the data to optimize manually.

### The 80/20 Rule
**Skip 80% of LinkedIn's features. Master these 3:**
- Sponsored Content (single image)
- Lead Gen Forms (native, not landing pages)
- Firmographic + Job Title targeting

## 4-Week Milestone Map

### Week 1: Survive & Learn ($210)
**Goal:** Don't panic. Gather intelligence.

**What Should Happen:**
- Days 1-3: High CPL ($300-500) - NORMAL
- Day 4-5: Algorithm starts learning, CPL drops to $200-250
- Day 7: First optimization checkpoint

**Milestones:**
- 3-5 leads minimum
- CTR above 0.50%
- LinkedIn Relevance Score >6/10
- Identify which audience responds better (A vs B)

**Daily Actions (15 min):**
- Check spend pacing (should be ~$30/day, no more)
- Monitor CTR (pause if <0.30% for 3 days)
- Review lead quality in CRM

**Decision Trigger:**
- **IF** CPL >$500 after Day 5 → Pause & diagnose (likely targeting too narrow)
- **IF** CTR <0.30% after Day 5 → Creative problem, not audience
- **IF** Leads are junk → Tighten job title targeting immediately

---

### Week 2: Scale the Winner ($350)
**Goal:** Find your repeatable winning combo.

**What Should Happen:**
- CPL stabilizes to $150-200
- One audience clearly outperforms (60/40 split or better)
- 8-12 total leads

**Milestones:**
- Increase budget to winning audience by 50%
- Pause underperforming audience if CPL >$250
- Hit 8+ leads for the week

**Optimization Actions:**
- Kill the losing audience (shift 100% budget to winner)
- Test ONE new creative variation (different headline only)
- Add 2-3 similar job titles to winning audience

**Decision Trigger:**
- **IF** CPL <$150 → Increase daily budget to $60 immediately
- **IF** CPL $150-200 → Stay the course, increase to $50/day
- **IF** CPL >$250 → Cut budget to $30/day, troubleshoot targeting

---

### Week 3: Retargeting Unlocks ($420)
**Goal:** Capture warm leads who didn't convert.

**What Should Happen:**
- Core campaign running at $50/day, CPL $150-175
- Launch retargeting at $10/day to engagers (video views, clicks, profile visits)
- Retargeting CPL should be 40-60% lower ($60-100)

**Milestones:**
- 15+ total leads (12 core, 3+ retarget)
- Retargeting CTR >1.0%
- Total CPL drops toward $150

**Retargeting Setup:**
- Audience: Anyone who engaged with ads in Week 1-2
- Offer: Different angle (case study vs demo, checklist vs consultation)
- Budget: $70 for the week ($10/day)

**Decision Trigger:**
- **IF** Retargeting CPL <$100 → Increase to $15/day
- **IF** Core CPL creeping up → Audience fatigue. Add 5 new job titles.
- **IF** Total leads <10 → Pause retargeting, double down on core

---

### Week 4: Efficiency Mode ($420)
**Goal:** Hit North Star CPL <$150.

**What Should Happen:**
- Core campaign optimized, budget $42/day (70%)
- Retargeting humming at $18/day (30%)
- 20+ leads for the week
- Cumulative CPL trends below $150

**Milestones:**
- 20+ leads this week
- Total campaign: 45-50 leads at ~$140-150 CPL
- 3+ qualified sales conversations booked

**Final Optimizations:**
- Negative targeting: Exclude job titles that converted poorly
- Bid cap test: If CPL <$130, try manual bid at $120
- Creative refresh: Swap underperforming ad

**Decision Trigger:**
- **IF** CPL <$130 → Deploy $600 reserve budget to scale
- **IF** CPL $130-170 → Maintain, prepare Month 2 strategy
- **IF** CPL >$200 → Cut budget 50%, audit everything

## Decision Framework: If/Then Logic

### Performance Triggers

| Scenario | Threshold | Action | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **High CPL** | >$300 for 3 days | Pause campaign, tighten targeting (senior titles only, reduce company size range) | Immediate |
| **Low CTR** | <0.30% for 3 days | Creative failure. Change headline + image. | Within 24h |
| **High CTR, Low Conversion** | CTR >0.8%, CVR <8% | Lead form too long OR wrong audience. Reduce form fields to 3. | Within 48h |
| **Rapid Budget Depletion** | Spending >$50/day in Week 1 | Check bid strategy (switch to auto-bid), reduce audience size | Immediate |
| **No Spend** | <$20/day for 2 days | Bid too low OR audience too small. Increase audience by 30%. | Within 24h |
| **Junk Leads** | >50% unqualified | Add seniority filter (Director+), exclude irrelevant job functions | Immediate |
| **Winner Found** | CPL <$150, consistent 3 days | Scale budget +40%, clone audience with adjacent job titles | Day 3 of success |
| **Audience Fatigue** | CTR drops >30% week-over-week | Refresh creative OR expand audience +20% | Within 48h |

### Budget Triggers

| Event | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Early Win** | CPL <$120 by Day 10 | Deploy reserve $600 immediately, increase to $80/day |
| **Slow Start** | <5 leads by Day 10 | Cut budget to $25/day, re-evaluate ICP targeting |
| **Mid-Month Pivot** | CPL >$250 by Day 15 | Pause all campaigns. Re-launch with tighter targeting. Reset to $30/day. |
| **Reserve Deployment** | Consistent CPL <$150 for 5 days | Add $20/day to core campaign only |

## Risk Mitigation Plan

### Top 5 Risks & Prevention

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Prevention | Early Warning Signal |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Budget Burn (Week 1)** | HIGH | Critical | Set account spending limit to $35/day in Campaign Manager | Spend >$40 on Day 1 |
| **Junk Leads** | HIGH | High | Pre-qualify in lead form: "What's your annual revenue?" (required field) | 3+ unqualified leads in first 5 |
| **Creative Fatigue** | MEDIUM | Medium | Prepare 2 backup creatives in Week 1 (don't launch yet) | CTR drops >25% week-over-week |
| **Wrong Audience** | MEDIUM | High | Validate ICP before launch: export 20 LinkedIn profiles that match targeting | CPL >$400 after Day 5 |
| **No Conversions** | LOW | Critical | Test lead form submit flow before launch (complete it yourself 3x) | 100+ clicks, 0 conversions |

### Emergency Playbook

**SCENARIO: Day 10, spent $400, 0 leads**
1. Pause all campaigns immediately
2. Audit checklist:
   - Is lead form actually working? (Test submit yourself)
   - Is targeting <10,000 audience size? (Too narrow)
   - Is CPM >$90? (Bid issue - switch to auto)
   - Is CTR <0.20%? (Creative is dead)
3. Fix the broken thing (likely targeting too narrow)
4. Re-launch at $20/day for 3 days
5. If still 0 leads → escalate to LinkedIn support

**SCENARIO: Week 3, CPL climbing from $150 to $220**
1. Audience fatigue confirmed. Act now:
   - Pause worst-performing ad set
   - Expand audience: add 5 new job titles (adjacent roles)
   - Refresh creative: new headline, keep same image
   - Reduce budget 20% until CPL stabilizes
2. Monitor for 3 days
3. If CPL still >$200 → consider campaign pause, reassess ICP

**SCENARIO: Week 2, leads are unqualified (wrong seniority)**
1. Immediately add seniority filter: Director, VP, C-Level only
2. Add negative targeting: Exclude "Intern," "Coordinator," "Assistant" job titles
3. Add pre-qualifier question to lead form: "What's your role in purchasing decisions?" (required)
4. Review next 5 leads. If still junk → pause and re-target.

## Success Definition

### Minimum Viable Success (Month 1)
- 40+ leads at $150 CPL or better
- 5+ qualified sales conversations booked
- 1 paying customer (even if small deal)
- Clear understanding of winning audience + creative combo

### Stretch Success
- 50+ leads at $130 CPL
- 8+ qualified sales conversations
- 2+ paying customers
- Proven retargeting playbook that scales to Month 2

### Failure = Learning
**If you don't hit targets, you MUST know why:**
- Was it targeting? (Wrong ICP, audience too broad/narrow)
- Was it creative? (Low CTR = bad ad)
- Was it offer? (High CTR, low conversion = weak offer)
- Was it budget? (Too little to generate statistical significance)

**Capture in post-mortem:**
- What I learned about my ICP's LinkedIn behavior
- Which job titles/seniority engaged most
- What creative angles resonated (or died)
- Whether LinkedIn is even the right channel for my offer

---

## Month 2 Setup (If Successful)

**Deploy in Week 4 so you're ready:**
1. Install LinkedIn Insight Tag (for real retargeting)
2. Create 2 new creative variations based on Week 1-4 learnings
3. Expand winning audience by 50% (adjacent job titles, industries)
4. Budget increase to $5,000 if CPL <$150
5. Introduce video ad to top 10% of Website Visitors (now you have data)

**Graduation Criteria:**
- Consistent CPL <$150 for 10+ days
- Lead quality >70% qualified
- Retargeting working (CPL <$100)
- You understand cause/effect in the platform

## Key Principles (Tattoo These)

1. **Simple Beats Clever:** One campaign, two audiences, two ads. That's it.
2. **Patience in Week 1:** Don't panic. LinkedIn's algorithm needs 5-7 days to learn.
3. **Kill Fast:** If something isn't working by Day 7, kill it. No "let's give it one more week."
4. **Scale Slowly:** 30-50% budget increases max. Never double overnight.
5. **Quality > Quantity:** 20 good leads beat 40 junk leads. Protect your sales team's time.
6. **Log Everything:** You're building institutional knowledge. Document daily.
7. **Reserve is Sacred:** Don't touch the $600 unless you've PROVEN success (CPL <$150 for 5 days).

---

## Tools You Need (Free)

1. **Google Sheet:** Lead tracking (Date, Name, Company, Title, Source, Quality Rating, CPL)
2. **LinkedIn Campaign Manager:** The platform itself
3. **Calendar Reminder:** Daily 9am check-in (non-negotiable)
4. **CRM:** Even if it's just a spreadsheet. Tag lead source = "LinkedIn"

---
