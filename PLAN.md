## Implementation Notes

**Agent Collaboration:**
- Steps 1-9 can be parallelized where appropriate (agents working on different sections simultaneously)
- Each agent should reference existing files in Linkedin Strategy folder
- Agents must cite specific sections/frameworks from source files
- No generic advice - all recommendations must be traceable to source material

**Document Philosophy:**
- Write for LLM consumption (clear structure, explicit decision rules, no ambiguity)
- Include both "what" and "why" for every recommendation
- Provide examples and templates wherever possible
- Balance comprehensiveness with usability (not a 100-page manual)

**Success Criteria:**
- Any agent with this document + company context can create a complete LinkedIn strategy
- All decisions are either rule-based or have clear decision trees
- No critical gaps that would require agent to make arbitrary choices
- Document is self-contained (minimal need to reference other files)
