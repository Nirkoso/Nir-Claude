# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a competitive analysis repository for ScaleFox.ai, an AI-powered marketing automation platform specializing in competitive intelligence-driven LinkedIn advertising. The repository contains strategic analysis documents used to inform product positioning, feature development, and go-to-market strategy.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains three primary markdown documents:

- **product-info.md** - Comprehensive product information and brand analysis for ScaleFox.ai, including value propositions, target audience, feature set, and brand positioning
- **competitive-analysis.md** - A detailed framework for conducting competitive analysis, with phases from competitor identification through strategic synthesis
- **competitors.md** - Analysis of 19 specific competitors across Direct, Indirect, Aspirational, and Adjacent categories

## Document Relationships

These documents work together as a competitive intelligence system:

1. **product-info.md** establishes ScaleFox's positioning, which serves as the baseline for competitive comparison
2. **competitive-analysis.md** provides the methodology and framework used to analyze competitors
3. **competitors.md** applies that framework to identify and analyze 19 specific competitors, resulting in strategic recommendations

## Working with These Documents

### When Analyzing Competitors

Reference the framework in **competitive-analysis.md** which includes 9 phases:
1. Competitor Identification
2. Data Collection
3. Product & Service Analysis
4. Marketing & Positioning Analysis
5. Digital Presence Analysis
6. Customer Analysis
7. Business Model Analysis
8. SWOT Analysis
9. Synthesis & Strategic Insights

### When Updating Competitor Intelligence

- Direct competitors (Bestever.ai, Zeely.ai) should be monitored weekly
- Indirect competitors should be monitored monthly
- Aspirational and Adjacent competitors should be monitored quarterly

### Key Competitive Differentiators

When working with these documents, ScaleFox's core differentiation is:
1. LinkedIn-first specialization (vs. multi-platform competitors)
2. Competitive intelligence integrated into campaign creation workflow
3. GTM Playbook approach (vs. template-based generation)
4. Target market: busy founders and marketers at B2B startups

## Document Maintenance

These are strategic analysis documents that should be updated based on:
- Competitive landscape changes (new features, pricing, positioning)
- ScaleFox product evolution
- Market trend shifts
- Customer feedback on competitive positioning

When editing these documents, maintain:
- Structured markdown formatting with clear headers
- Factual, objective analysis tone
- Actionable insights and recommendations
- Update timestamps when making material changes
