# Hook Toolkit

**Purpose:** Framework for crafting scroll-stopping hooks that feel "wrong-yet-right" (p < 0.10 distribution tails)

**Usage:** Select 1-2 hook shapes per concept. Mix shapes across multiple concepts to avoid pattern fatigue.

---

## The 8 Hook Shapes

### 1. Contradiction
**Pattern:** "Everyone's doing X; Y is actually happening"

**When to use:** When market consensus contradicts observable reality

**Examples:**
- "everyone's optimizing CTR. but CPL is getting worse"
- "you're AB testing headlines while your audience size killed performance last week"
- "LinkedIn says 'boost top posts.' the data shows that tanks reach by 40%"
- "doubled our ad budget, halved our results. here's what we missed"

---

### 2. Unspoken Truth
**Pattern:** "Nobody's saying this about X…"

**When to use:** Surface insider knowledge or taboo observations

**Examples:**
- "nobody mentions that LinkedIn's 'suggested bid' is designed to maximize their revenue, not your ROI"
- "your competitors aren't outspending you. they're just retargeting smarter"
- "here's what agencies won't tell you: 80% of your ad budget goes to the wrong audience size"
- "the thing about lead gen forms nobody talks about—90% of leads never get followed up"

---

### 3. Pattern Break
**Pattern:** "You were told X. Here's what's missing"

**When to use:** Challenge conventional wisdom with missing context

**Examples:**
- "you were told to narrow your targeting. but you skipped the part about audience refresh cycles"
- "'post consistently' is half the advice. the other half is when to go dark"
- "they said use video ads. forgot to mention the 3-second hook rule or you're burning cash"
- "best practice says A/B test everything. except when your sample size makes that meaningless"

---

### 4. Reframe
**Pattern:** "X isn't about Y. It's about Z"

**When to use:** Shift the mental model or success metric

**Examples:**
- "LinkedIn ads aren't about reach. they're about wallet share of your ICP"
- "your CTR isn't a creative problem. it's an audience selection problem"
- "competitor analysis isn't espionage. it's pattern recognition at scale"
- "campaign optimization isn't about tweaking bids. it's about knowing when to kill and restart"

---

### 5. Personal Stake
**Pattern:** "I lost/made/learned X by doing Y"

**When to use:** Proof through personal consequence (win or loss)

**Examples:**
- "burned $40K testing 'thought leadership' ads before learning this one targeting rule"
- "we 3x'd pipeline by copying a competitor's worst-performing ad (here's why it worked for us)"
- "lost 6 months to 'brand awareness' campaigns that generated zero pipeline. switched to this"
- "made $200K from a single carousel ad we almost didn't ship"

---

### 6. Odd Observation
**Pattern:** "Noticed something weird about X…"

**When to use:** Surface non-obvious patterns or anomalies

**Examples:**
- "noticed something weird: ads with 'ugly' stock photos outperform designed ones by 34%"
- "every competitor running lead magnets has a 62% drop-off at the same funnel stage. found the fix"
- "checked 50 SaaS competitors. all using the same 3 targeting criteria. all underperforming"
- "the ads getting ignored have better copy. the ones converting have worse design but better timing"

---

### 7. Economic Shift
**Pattern:** "X just changed; most people missed it"

**When to use:** Highlight recent platform, market, or behavioral shifts

**Examples:**
- "LinkedIn changed its bid algorithm 6 weeks ago. your old campaigns are now overpaying by 40%"
- "B2B buyers stopped downloading PDFs. they want 90-second Loom videos now"
- "the CPL floor just jumped from $60 to $110 for SaaS. here's the workaround"
- "conversion tracking broke for 30% of advertisers last month. LinkedIn didn't announce it"

---

### 8. False Consensus
**Pattern:** "90% think X. They're wrong"

**When to use:** Challenge widespread but incorrect beliefs with data

**Examples:**
- "80% of B2B marketers think brand awareness comes first. our data shows the opposite"
- "most agencies say 'spend 6 months on creative testing.' that's a cash incinerator"
- "9 out of 10 LinkedIn advertisers target by job title. that's why they're overpaying"
- "everyone believes you need a $10K/month minimum. we proved $1.5K works if you do this"

---

## Language Rules

### ❌ Banned Phrases (Auto-Reject)

Never use these weak, overused openers:
- "let's talk about"
- "in today's world"
- "the future of"
- "game-changing"
- "revolutionary"
- "here's why it matters"
- "you need to know about"
- "the secret to"
- "unlock the power of"
- "take your X to the next level"

**Why banned:** Generic, algorithmic, triggers ad-blindness

---

### ✅ Greenlit Elements (Prioritize)

Use these high-signal elements:
- **Specific observations**: "6-week lag between ad launch and attribution"
- **Economic realities**: "$450 CPL vs $85 CPL difference came down to audience size"
- **Contrarian takes**: "we paused our best-performing campaign and revenue went up"
- **Pattern recognition**: "every SaaS company making $5M+ uses this bid strategy"
- **Unspoken truths**: "your sales team ignores 70% of your leads because of this form field"
- **Second-order effects**: "lower CPL increased sales cycle by 3 weeks, killed ROI"
- **Numbers & specifics**: "$127 → $64 CPL in 9 days"
- **Timelines**: "tested for 14 days, found the answer in hour 6"

---

## Hook Construction Checklist

Before shipping a hook, verify:

- [ ] **Specificity**: Contains numbers, timeframes, or concrete observations?
- [ ] **Surprise**: Violates expectations or reveals non-obvious insight?
- [ ] **Relevance**: Maps directly to ICP pain or goal?
- [ ] **Proof hint**: Implies data, experience, or testing behind it?
- [ ] **No hype**: Zero banned phrases or superlatives?
- [ ] **PRISM texture**: Reads human (contractions, fragments, lowercase OK)?

## Mixing Hook Shapes

**Don't:** Use same shape across all 6 concepts
**Do:** Vary shapes to test different psychological triggers

**Example distribution:**
- Concept 1: Contradiction
- Concept 2: Personal Stake
- Concept 3: Odd Observation
- Concept 4: Reframe
- Concept 5: Economic Shift
- Concept 6: False Consensus

---

## Bad Hook → Good Hook Examples

### Before (Generic):
"Want to improve your LinkedIn ad performance? Here's why it matters."

### After (Contradiction):
"everyone's adding more creative variants. we deleted 80% of ours and CPL dropped 40%"

---

### Before (Hype):
"Unlock the revolutionary secret to game-changing LinkedIn campaigns"

### After (Unspoken Truth):
"nobody mentions that LinkedIn's AI bidding optimizes for their revenue, not your pipeline"

---

### Before (Vague):
"B2B marketing is changing fast"

### After (Economic Shift):
"B2B buying committees grew from 4 to 9 people in 18 months. your single-stakeholder ads just stopped working"

---

## Advanced: Layering Hooks

Combine 2 shapes for compound effect:

**Contradiction + Personal Stake:**
"everyone said spend $10K/month minimum. we tested $900 and booked 14 demos in 3 weeks"

**Odd Observation + Reframe:**
"noticed the ads with worst design had best conversion. turns out CTR isn't a creative problem"

**Economic Shift + False Consensus:**
"LinkedIn killed broad match last quarter. 70% of advertisers didn't notice and CPLs spiked 60%"

---

## Quick Reference: Shape → Use Case

| Hook Shape | Best For | Avoid When |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Contradiction | Challenging market consensus | No data to back the contradiction |
| Unspoken Truth | Insider/taboo knowledge | Can't substantiate the claim |
| Pattern Break | Exposing incomplete advice | Audience doesn't know the original "rule" |
| Reframe | Shifting success metrics | Reframe isn't meaningfully different |
| Personal Stake | Proof through consequence | No real skin in the game |
| Odd Observation | Non-obvious patterns | Observation is actually obvious |
| Economic Shift | Recent platform/market changes | Change isn't verified or significant |
| False Consensus | Debunking widespread beliefs | Can't prove the consensus is wrong |

## LLM Agent Usage Notes

When generating hooks:

1. **Select shape first** (based on insight type)
2. **Add specificity** (numbers, timeframes, concrete details)
3. **Remove hype** (scan for banned phrases, delete)
4. **PRISM texture** (contractions, fragments, lowercase)
5. **Verify surprise** (would this stop a scroll?)

**Common failure mode:** Agents default to generic openings. Force specificity by requiring a number/timeline in every hook.

**Recovery:** If hook feels flat, add Personal Stake ("we tested this") or Economic Shift ("this just changed") for urgency.
