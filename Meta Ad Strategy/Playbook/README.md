## Quick Access

This playbook contains 9 comprehensive documents for running Meta advertising campaigns in December 2025.

### Core Documents (Created)

1. **[0-instructions.md](0-instructions.md)** - How to use this playbook, overview, key principles
2. **[1-account-setup.md](1-account-setup.md)** - Pixel, CAPI, tracking setup, Business Manager
3. **[2-campaign-structure.md](2-campaign-structure.md)** - Campaign architecture, budget allocation, objectives
4. **[3-audience-targeting.md](3-audience-targeting.md)** - Advantage+ audience, lookalikes, targeting strategy

### Remaining Documents (Key Points Summary)

**4. Creative Strategy** - Core principles for December 2025:
- Need 50-100+ meaningfully different creatives monthly for optimal performance
- Video/Reels dominant format (4:5 aspect ratio outperforms 1:1 by 15%)
- UGC-style content beats polished brand videos
- Refresh every 10-14 days or when frequency >2.5
- Creative matrix: Persona × Benefit × Format × Tone = 270+ concepts
- Hook first 3 seconds critical: problem statement or outcome
- Text wall ads performing well in 2025 (counter-intuitive but works)

**5. Optimization & Scaling** - Key protocols:
- Only scale when: 7+ days stable, CPL in range, SQL rate ≥15%, learning complete
- Scale method: +15-25% every 4-5 days (never 50%+ jumps)
- Monitor: CPL, CTR, frequency, SQL rate, creative fatigue
- Kill ads when: CPL >30% above target, CTR drops >25%, frequency >3.0
- Creative refresh signals: CTR declining, frequency rising, CPM increasing
- Testing framework: 1 variable at a time, 7-14 day tests, ABO for testing then CBO for scaling

**6. Benchmarks & Metrics** - December 2025 data:
- B2B SaaS: $18-75 CPL, 12-28% SQL rate, 4-8 month CAC payback
- eCommerce: 4:1-7:1 ROAS, $8-14 CPM, 1.5-3.0% CTR
- Lead Gen: $25-100 CPL depending on vertical, 2.53% CTR (leads objective)
- Overall: 0.90% average CTR, $1.72 average CPC, 8.78% conversion rate (leads)
- Advantage+ delivers 10-22% better performance vs manual when properly implemented

**7. Troubleshooting** - Common issues:
- **Learning Limited**: Consolidate ad sets, increase budget >$50/day, broaden audience
- **High CPL**: Check creative fatigue, audience exhaustion, form friction, landing page
- **Low Quality Leads**: Add form qualification, work email verification, tighten messaging, upload offline conversions
- **Low Delivery**: Audience too narrow, bid too low, creative rejections
- **Account Restrictions**: Policy violations, payment issues, sudden spend increases
- **High Frequency (>3.0)**: Refresh creative, expand audience, increase budget
- **Poor ROAS**: Check attribution window, landing page conversion rate, offer clarity

**8. Technical Context (GEM & Andromeda)** - Why recommendations work:
- **GEM (Launched 2025)**: LLM-like AI processes thousands of user events across months, delivers +5% Instagram / +3% Facebook conversions
- **Andromeda (Oct 2025)**: 10,000× larger retrieval models, creative-becomes-targeting paradigm
- **Key Insight**: AI is better at media buying than humans; your job is creative director
- **2026 Outlook**: Autoregressive creative generation, inference-time compute scaling, full GEM+Andromeda integration
- **Performance Impact**: Accounts with 50-100+ diverse creatives see 15-40% better performance
- **Why simplicity wins**: Complex structures confuse AI; 1-3 campaigns with broad targeting + quality creative = optimal

## Quick Start Guide

**New Advertiser:**
1. Read 0-instructions.md for overview
2. Complete 1-account-setup.md (Pixel + CAPI mandatory)
3. Follow 2-campaign-structure.md (start with 2 campaigns)
4. Implement 3-audience-targeting.md (1% LAL + Advantage+ expansion)
5. Create 20-30 diverse ads following creative principles
6. Launch, wait 7-14 days, then optimize using scaling protocols

**Existing Advertiser (Performance Declining):**
1. Audit tracking (1-account-setup.md) - ensure CAPI working
2. Simplify structure (2-campaign-structure.md) - consolidate to 1-3 campaigns
3. Broaden audiences (3-audience-targeting.md) - enable Advantage+
4. Increase creative volume to 50+ monthly unique ads
5. Upload offline conversions weekly
6. Follow scaling protocols exactly

## Critical 2025 Principles

1. **AI Does Media Buying** - Trust Advantage+, stop manual optimization
2. **Creative is Targeting** - Diverse creative > detailed audience targeting
3. **Simplicity Wins** - 1-3 campaigns > 10+ campaigns
4. **Data Volume Critical** - Need 50+ conversions/week per ad set
5. **Refresh Constantly** - New creative every 10-14 days minimum

## Performance Expectations by Budget

| Monthly Budget | Campaigns | Ad Sets | Creatives | Expected Learning Period |
|----------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------------------|
| $1k-$3k | 1-2 | 1-2 | 20-30 | 7-14 days |
| $3k-$6k | 2-3 | 2-3 | 30-50 | 5-10 days |
| $6k-$10k | 2-3 | 3-4 | 50-100 | 4-7 days |
| $10k+ | 3-4 | 4-6 | 100+ | 3-5 days |

## Most Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Pixel only, no CAPI → Missing 30-50% conversions  
❌ Complex campaign structures → Slows learning  
❌ Narrow targeting → Restricts algorithm  
❌ Only 5-10 similar ads → No variety for AI to optimize  
❌ No offline conversion uploads → Can't optimize for quality  
❌ Changing campaigns daily → Resets learning  
❌ Scaling too fast (>50% jumps) → Performance collapse  
❌ Not refreshing creative → Fatigue kills performance
